Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced by deep learning
architectures, notably U-Net variants. However, existing models struggle to
achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning
under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose
a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation.
Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range
reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers,
simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic
abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending
state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing

knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human
action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been
propelled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grants the models
access to vast external knowledge bases. Despite RAG's success in improving
agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing,
maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to
each agent's need, remains underexplored. Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent
RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that
dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing
historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached
items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance
cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our
experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to
0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and
reducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can
drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern machine translation (MT) systems depend on large parallel corpora,
often collected from the Internet. However, recent evidence indicates that (i)
a substantial portion of these texts are machine-generated translations, and
(ii) an overreliance on such synthetic content in training data can
significantly degrade translation quality. As a result, filtering out non-human
translations is becoming an essential pre-processing step in building
high-quality MT systems. In this work, we propose a novel approach that
directly exploits the internal representations of a surrogate multilingual MT
model to distinguish between human and machine-translated sentences.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
techniques, particularly for non-English language pairs, achieving gains of at
least 5 percentage points of accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic
spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this
problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,
advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions
that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic
scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to
learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,
degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment
between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for
effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and
vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.
This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D
scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address
this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse
tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate
alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed
instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world
environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge
by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with
LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.
Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in
generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.

Abstract: We introduce an Analyze-Revise-Finetune (ARF) pipeline that enables smaller

categorizes common errors in summaries produced by a teacher model (GPT-3.5),
then performs a targeted revision using a compact editor model (Llama 3.1 70B)
to generate high-quality, refined training data. Fine-tuning a smaller student
model (Llama 3.1 8B) on this refined data resulted in superior summarization
performance compared to GPT-3.5. The ARF pipeline improves cost efficiency and
data privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy, illustrating a
generalizable framework for enhancing open-source LLMs across diverse
downstream applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining
approach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific
entities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid
growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in
commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet
low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation
challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive
in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.
Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly
rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent
the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through
three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text
Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates
realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation
with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present
the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;
<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education
review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and
weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask
fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling
1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark
results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first
public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in
low-resource domains.

Abstract: We present ROBOTO2, an open-source, web-based platform for large language
model (LLM)-assisted risk of bias (ROB) assessment of clinical trials. ROBOTO2
streamlines the traditionally labor-intensive ROB v2 (ROB2) annotation process
via an interactive interface that combines PDF parsing, retrieval-augmented LLM
prompting, and human-in-the-loop review. Users can upload clinical trial
reports, receive preliminary answers and supporting evidence for ROB2 signaling
questions, and provide real-time feedback or corrections to system suggestions.
ROBOTO2 is publicly available at https://roboto2.vercel.app/, with code and
data released to foster reproducibility and adoption. We construct and release
a dataset of 521 pediatric clinical trial reports (8954 signaling questions
with 1202 evidence passages), annotated using both manually and LLM-assisted
methods, serving as a benchmark and enabling future research. Using this
dataset, we benchmark ROB2 performance for 4 LLMs and provide an analysis into
current model capabilities and ongoing challenges in automating this critical
aspect of systematic review.

Abstract: Conversational AI is constrained in many real-world settings where only one
side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and
smart glasses. We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC):
inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1)
reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2)
generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and
finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B
testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and
information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder
prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate
promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning.
Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing
turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that
mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.

Abstract: Text Normalization (TN) is a key preprocessing step in Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems, converting written forms into their canonical spoken equivalents.
Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial
engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language
coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a
prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to
reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic
applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a
language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed
to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments
across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER)
compared to a production-grade-based system. To support further research, we
release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of
text normalization phenomena.

Abstract: Language disruptions are one of the well-known effects of schizophrenia
symptoms. They are often manifested as disorganized speech and impaired
discourse coherence. These abnormalities in spontaneous language production
reflect underlying cognitive disturbances and have the potential to serve as
objective markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. This
study focuses on how these language disruptions can be characterized in terms
of two computational linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. By
computing surprisal and semantic coherence of language using computational
models, this study investigates how they differ between subjects with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, this study provides further
insight into how language disruptions in terms of these linguistic measures
change with varying degrees of schizophrenia symptom severity.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect millions worldwide, yet early detection
remains a major challenge, particularly for Arabic-speaking populations where
resources are limited and mental health discourse is often discouraged due to
cultural stigma. While substantial research has focused on English-language
mental health detection, Arabic remains significantly underexplored, partly due
to the scarcity of annotated datasets. We present CARMA, the first
automatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts. The dataset
encompasses six mental health conditions, such as Anxiety, Autism, and
Depression, and a control group. CARMA surpasses existing resources in both
scale and diversity. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of
lexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the
linguistic markers of specific mental health conditions. To demonstrate the
dataset's potential for further mental health analysis, we perform
classification experiments using a range of models, from shallow classifiers to
large language models. Our results highlight the promise of advancing mental
health detection in underrepresented languages such as Arabic.

Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language

user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety
filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in
the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this
safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes
without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model
regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter
design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source
language models, aiming to generate positive text.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As reasoning models scale rapidly, the essential role of multimodality in
human cognition has come into sharp relief, driving a growing need to probe
vision-centric cognitive behaviors. Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either
overemphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing
vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs
insufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC
(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded
benchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three
fundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and
knowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'
cognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct
extensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that
closed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.
30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak
(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,
including orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and
poor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that
Chain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->
verify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a
shift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both
evaluation and model design.

Abstract: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is
essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for
stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict

framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how
different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate
our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous
vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive
visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder
perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show
that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and
conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these
stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more
transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance
goals.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly pervasive, finding
applications across many industries and disciplines. Ensuring the
trustworthiness of LLM outputs is paramount, where Uncertainty Estimation (UE)
plays a key role. In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to
examine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE
methods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM
criticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in
Question-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Our analysis reveals that information-based
methods, which leverage token and sequence probabilities, perform exceptionally
well in ID settings due to their alignment with the model's understanding of
the data. Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit
superior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in
capturing the model's epistemic uncertainty. Semantic consistency methods,
which assess variability in generated answers, show reliable performance across
different datasets and generation metrics. These methods generally perform well
but may not be optimal for every situation.

first large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural
contexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting,
Family Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally
relevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus
using three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct
systematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including
Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and
standard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative
analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense
reasoning, and moral fairness. BengaliMoralBench provides a foundation for
responsible localization, enabling culturally aligned evaluation and supporting
the deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet
struggle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned
terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity
by extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural
language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these
meta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these
relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM,
improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses.
Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely
on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to
process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing
RAG baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can
lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time,
knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence,
yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge
graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking
approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system
comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid
one - hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a
task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based
logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient.
Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the
Supported/Refuted split without task- specific fine - tuning. To address Not
enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that
our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled
as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM
reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking
pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Tokenizers play a crucial role in determining the performance, training
efficiency, and the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs). Designing
effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to
diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in
multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a
tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and
multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading
to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in
fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data,
our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by
18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in
inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on
English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across
tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and
pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to
enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination.
Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in
question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance
of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat,
Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA
tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation
metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary
questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini,
alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired
with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its
status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's
Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary
and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b
reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas
LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research
underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with
proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.

Abstract: We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that
progress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling
parameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that
inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all
pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies
and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original
functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,
which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented
initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative
Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to
acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as
SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and
SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing
between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography
benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion
while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean
corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and
competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best
overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when
preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and
adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning
setups.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically
performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference
translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the
limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from
the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that
neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with
human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the
source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments
between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct
the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular
focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not
available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual
proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and
back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch
between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried
out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with
diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts
constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word
error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a
computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT
metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled
evaluation methodologies for speech translation.

Abstract: A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is
the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their
internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode")
alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models
to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating
a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these
"dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning
processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical
tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two
leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We
assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and
ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the
thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for
the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as
open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,
highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced
methods for medical knowledge integration.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative
approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics,
proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To
systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review
proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to
evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive
performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for
advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological
analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics
subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),
which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern
recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model
architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to
targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant
benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data
integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.
RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and
synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests
the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that
impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust
evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular
datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as
CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly
support the training and generalization of GenAI models.

Abstract: Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly
widespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential
and biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness
of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize
standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook
deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive
fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,
we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences
encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by
safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases
often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which
present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with
additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to
uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals
during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects,
presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future
development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment
training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings
expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their
underlying fairness issues.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has
set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy
requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device
applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client
interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative,
they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing
emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This
paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability
gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates
game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional
states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs
with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating
conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent
simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial
debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show
that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt
recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its
size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles
to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints.
Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw
model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation,
paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators
that can operate on the edge.

Abstract: For complex logical data augmentation, heavy reliance on human annotation is

uninterpretable and logically homogeneous examples. To address this, we present
LFC-DA, a symbolic-logic-controlled pipeline: logical text is first mapped to
propositional expressions, a compact rule library is compiled, and a bounded
state-space search systematically discovers valid formulas that are then
verbalized back into natural-language questions, ensuring both diversity and
logical rigor under propositional logic. Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA show
significant improvements in the logical-reasoning accuracy of pretrained
models, confirming the effectiveness of LFC-DA for LLM-guided logical data
augmentation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing Machine Translation (MT) research often suggests a single, fixed set
of hyperparameters for word segmentation models, symmetric Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE), which applies the same number of merge operations (NMO) to train
tokenizers for both source and target languages. However, we demonstrate that
this uniform approach doesn't guarantee optimal MT performance across different
language pairs and data sizes. This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes
across various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system
performance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target
languages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the
symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K
sentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant
($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in
low-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language
pairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut),
observing statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems
compared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K
to 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results,
particularly benefiting low-resource MT.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have shown promises for relation extraction (RE)
when extracting RDF triples guided by SHACL shapes focused on common datatype
properties. This paper investigates how SLMs handle both datatype and object
properties for a complete RDF graph extraction. We show that the key bottleneck
is related to long-tail distribution of rare properties. To solve this issue,
we evaluate several strategies: stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset
scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation. We show that the best
strategy to perform equally well over unbalanced target properties is to build
a training set where the number of occurrences of each property exceeds a given
threshold. To enable reproducibility, we publicly released our datasets,
experimental results and code. Our findings offer practical guidance for
training shape-aware SLMs and highlight promising directions for future work in
semantic RE.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have leveraged explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve reasoning accuracy. However, most
existing methods primarily compress verbose reasoning outputs. These
Long-to-Short transformations aim to improve efficiency, but still rely on
explicit reasoning during inference. In this work, we introduce \textbf{3TF}
(\textbf{T}hought-\textbf{T}raining and \textbf{T}hought-\textbf{F}ree
inference), a framework for efficient reasoning that takes a Short-to-Long
perspective. We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning
and non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to
internalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs
at inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based
approaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs,
enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping
external outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large
improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference,
demonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed
implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

Abstract: Input errors in question-answering (QA) systems often lead to incorrect
responses. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently
failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering
the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a
framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it
enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related
entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to
align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our
results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding
faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more
effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's
ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two
strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question
correction task.

Abstract: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is an essential skill in the

support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for
critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an
original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and
reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students,
the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike
existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and
reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions
reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed
an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens
considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on
questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval
provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM
limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for
critical appraisal.

validation task, shifting from single SHACL shape validation to evaluating all
possible combinations of properties derived from the shape. By selecting the
optimal combination for each training example, the framework significantly
enhances model generalization and performance. Additionally, Kastor employs an
iterative learning process to refine noisy knowledge bases, enabling the

Abstract: Large language models work well for technical problem solving in English but

would be to translate Bangla questions into English first and then use these
models. However, existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with
technical terms. They often mistranslate specialized vocabulary, which changes
the meaning of the problem and leads to wrong answers. We present BanglaSTEM, a
dataset of 5,000 carefully selected Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM
fields including computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and
biology. We generated over 12,000 translations using language models and then
used human evaluators to select the highest quality pairs that preserve
technical terminology correctly. We train a T5-based translation model on
BanglaSTEM and test it on two tasks: generating code and solving math problems.
Our results show significant improvements in translation accuracy for technical
content, making it easier for Bangla speakers to use English-focused language
models effectively. Both the BanglaSTEM dataset and the trained translation
model are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/reyazul/BanglaSTEM-T5.

Abstract: Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI
agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during
memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory
hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.
Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question
answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within
the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the
Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines
three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question
answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different
operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct
user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and
HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type
questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,
with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations
across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based
on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate
hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently
propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus
on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that
systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

Abstract: Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions
throughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for
data-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often
limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and
failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we
propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following
ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from
user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints,
instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by
enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and
tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated
user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the
interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving
instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types.
Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following
performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and
demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant
margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code
will be made publicly available online.

Abstract: Any finite set of training data is consistent with an infinite number of
hypothetical algorithms that could have generated it. Studies have shown that
when human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on
hierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.
A recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network
architectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special
conditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,
or when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the
first time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in
human-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:
stack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,
simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack
of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed
by DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic
stacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question
formation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture
that improves hierarchical generalization. These results suggest that
stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language
acquisition than standard architectures, serving as useful objects of
psycholinguistic study. Our code is publicly available.

sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a
reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini
puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5
puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the
common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no
correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of
128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic
languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5. We publish code for puzzle generation,
designed for adaptablity into more languages and themes.

Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable
locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that
enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization
through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models
that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows
dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and
efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We
conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer
architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\lambda} across
the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our
results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower
attention entropy, with {\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18
bits at {\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer
fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets.
Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the
tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\lambda} = 0.6
achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings
establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for
applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability,
offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance
spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design
principles.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
better support policymakers in their crucial work of understanding, analyzing,
and crafting legal regulations. To equip the model with a deep understanding of
legal texts, we curated a supervised dataset tailored to the specific needs of
the legal domain. Additionally, we integrated the Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) method, enabling the LLM to access and incorporate up-to-date
legal knowledge from external sources. This combination of fine-tuning and
RAG-based augmentation results in a tool that not only processes legal
information but actively assists policymakers in interpreting regulations and
drafting new ones that align with current needs. The results demonstrate that
this approach can significantly enhance the effectiveness of legal research and
regulation development, offering a valuable resource in the ever-evolving field
of law.

Abstract: We present Step-Audio-EditX, the first open-source LLM-based audio model
excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion,
speaking style, and paralinguistics alongside robust zero-shot text-to-speech
(TTS) capabilities.Our core innovation lies in leveraging only large-margin
synthetic data, which circumvents the need for embedding-based priors or
auxiliary modules. This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative
control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot
from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement. Evaluation
results demonstrate that Step-Audio-EditX surpasses both MiniMax-2.6-hd and
Doubao-Seed-TTS-2.0 in emotion editing and other fine-grained control tasks.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward
unseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data
augmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between
text and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD
focus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating
explanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by
their over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that
lack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it
difficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our
study, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an
interpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target
implicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and
explicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers
stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the
relevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model
towards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,
thus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales
based on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive
dimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's
attitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark
datasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%
training data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the
proposed architecture and interpretable design.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technologies,
the demand for high-quality Chinese document question-answering datasets is
steadily growing. To address this issue, we present the Chinese Multi-Document
Question Answering Dataset(ChiMDQA), specifically designed for downstream
business scenarios across prevalent domains including academic, education,
finance, law, medical treatment, and news. ChiMDQA encompasses long-form
documents from six distinct fields, consisting of 6,068 rigorously curated,
high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs further classified into ten
fine-grained categories. Through meticulous document screening and a systematic
question-design methodology, the dataset guarantees both diversity and high
quality, rendering it applicable to various NLP tasks such as document
comprehension, knowledge extraction, and intelligent QA systems. Additionally,
this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the dataset's design objectives,
construction methodologies, and fine-grained evaluation system, supplying a
substantial foundation for future research and practical applications in
Chinese QA. The code and data are available at:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
conspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this
domain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial
perspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of
misinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a
critical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are
increasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known
about whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a
conspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated
psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under
different prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs
show partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning
with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent
demographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses
toward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs
to manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive
contexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the
psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social
science and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing
common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while
referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme
for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures
speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,
enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over
time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k
annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the
resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings
are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies
systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask
referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an
analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating
(V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative
dialogue.
