In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft \"verifiers\". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains."}

Despite these advancements, research on LLMs has primarily targeted high-resourced languages (e.g., English), and only recently has attention shifted toward multilingual models. However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies.

In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

We fine-tune pretrained LLMs using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), scoping the model to an initial decision module within the claim processing pipeline to speed up claim adjusters' decisions. We assess this module using a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that combines automated semantic similarity metrics with human evaluation, enabling a rigorous examination of both practical utility and predictive accuracy.

Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time. Demonstrated on an open-source synthetic dataset for post-earthquake inspections, the proposed approach offers a promising solution for comprehensive 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure digital twins."}

The proposed method assesses both factual accuracy and content coverage through automatically generated questions and answers derived from the source document and the summary. A single multilingual instruction-tuned language model handles question generation, question answering, candidate answer extraction, and question importance weighting. This unified design reduces system complexity and computational cost. To capture semantic consistency beyond surface-level overlap, we use BERTScore-Recall for answer comparison. We validate BanglaSummEval on 300 human-written summaries from educational and medical domains, demonstrating strong correlation with expert human judgments (Pearson's $r = 0.694$, Spearman's $ρ= 0.763$). By providing interpretable, step-wise diagnostics alongside reliable evaluation scores, BanglaSummEval offers a practical and transparent solution for factual consistency evaluation in low-resource language settings."}

In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction.

However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%. This highlights that additional resources and an intensification of research efforts focused on German dialects are desperately needed."}

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines."}

The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy. The conceptual model includes both classical and quantum security methods, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for Post-Quantum encryption data protection.

Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID, with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics. We quantify semantic fairness using a Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), which measures the alignment between coverage and error. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SemCovNet enhances model reliability and substantially reduces CDI, achieving fairer and more equitable performance. This work establishes SCI as a measurable and correctable bias, providing a foundation for advancing semantic fairness and interpretable vision learning."}

We categorize Potentially Euphemistic Terms (PETs) in Turkish and English into Overlapping (OPETs) and Non-Overlapping (NOPETs) subsets based on their functional, pragmatic, and semantic alignment. Our findings reveal a transfer asymmetry: semantic overlap is insufficient to guarantee positive transfer, particularly in low-resource Turkish-to-English direction, where performance can degrade even for overlapping euphemisms, and in some cases, improve under NOPET-based training. Differences in label distribution help explain these counterintuitive results. Category-level analysis suggests that transfer may be influenced by domain-specific alignment, though evidence is limited by sparsity."}

We present an uncertainty-aware computational framework for poet-level psychological analysis based on large-scale automatic multi-label annotation. Each verse is associated with a set of psychological concepts, per-label confidence scores, and an abstention flag that signals insufficient evidence. We aggregate confidence-weighted evidence into a Poet $\\times$ Concept matrix, interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts, and quantify poetic individuality as divergence from a corpus baseline using Jensen--Shannon divergence and Kullback--Leibler divergence. To capture relational structure beyond marginals, we build a confidence-weighted co-occurrence graph over concepts and define an Eigenmood embedding through Laplacian spectral decomposition. On a corpus of 61{,}573 verses across 10 poets, 22.2\\% of verses are abstained, underscoring the analytical importance of uncertainty. We further report sensitivity analysis under confidence thresholding, selection-bias diagnostics that treat abstention as a category, and a distant-to-close workflow that retrieves verse-level exemplars along Eigenmood axes.

HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows."}

We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality.

To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts."}

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels."}

However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior."}

Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure.

The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections.

Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning.

We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles.

To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures.

In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization."}

Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy. The method further attains 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses."}

Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation."}

However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance."}

In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories. We identify the strengths and limitations of RPDR through detailed human analysis and propose a dynamic routing mechanism to dynamically route queries to specialized retrieval modules to further improve retrieval performance."}

In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens."}

The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour."}

Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an \"Entropy Collapse Layer\" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance.

This paper proposes a revised CDCR annotation scheme of the NewsWCL50 dataset, treating coreference chains as discourse elements (DEs) and conceptual units of analysis. The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking \"the caravan\" - \"asylum seekers\" - \"those contemplating illegal entry\", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline. The results show that the reannotated datasets align closely, falling between the original ECB+ and NewsWCL50, thereby supporting balanced and discourse-aware CDCR research in the news domain."}

This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment."}

We present \\textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\\% in FDE, 12\\% in ADE, and a 4\\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet.

We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs.

U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were thus employed as lightweight convolutional decoders to assess how well the geospatial information distilled in the embeddings can be translated into accurate surface height estimates. Both architectures achieved strong training performance (both with $R^2 = 0.97$), confirming that the embeddings encode informative and decodable height-related signals. On the test set, performance decreased due to distribution shifts in height frequency between training and testing areas. Nevertheless, U-Net++ shows better generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared with the standard U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), suggesting enhanced robustness to distribution mismatch. While the testing RMSE (approximately 16 m for U-Net++) and residual bias highlight remaining challenges in generalization, strong correlations indicate that the embeddings capture transferable topographic patterns.

We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured \"20 Questions\" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures.

Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery."}

Our research addresses Cross-Lingual Sentiment Misalignment between Bengali and English by benchmarking four transformer architectures.

We demonstrate that compressed model (mDistilBERT) exhibits 28.7% \"Sentiment Inversion Rate,\" fundamentally misinterpreting positive user intent as negative (or vice versa). Furthermore, we identify systemic nuances affecting human-AI trust, including \"Asymmetric Empathy\" where some models systematically dampen and others amplify the affective weight of Bengali text relative to its English counterpart. Finally, we reveal a \"Modern Bias\" in the regional model (IndicBERT), which shows a 57% increase in alignment error when processing formal (Sadhu) Bengali. We argue that equitable human-AI co-evolution requires pluralistic, culturally grounded alignment that respects language and dialectal diversity over universal compression, which fails to preserve the emotional fidelity required for reciprocal human-AI trust.

To address this, previous work has attempted to generate tampered documents using rule-based methods. However, the resulting documents often suffer from limited variety and poor visual quality, typically leaving highly visible artifacts that are rarely observed in real-world manipulations. This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones. Using a carefully designed generation pipeline that leverages both networks, we introduce a framework capable of producing diverse, high-quality tampered document images. We assess the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline by training multiple models on datasets derived from the same source images, generated using our method and existing approaches, under identical training protocols. Evaluating these models on various open-source datasets shows that our pipeline yields consistent performance improvements across architectures and datasets."}

Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines."}

They are structured into labelled sections; recognizing these sections has been shown to support clinical decision-making and downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we advance clinical section segmentation through three key contributions. First, we curate a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset, to supplement the medical domains covered in public corpora such as MIMIC-III, on which most existing segmentation approaches are trained. Second, we systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised models for section segmentation on a curated subset of MIMIC-III (in-domain), and on the new obstetrics dataset (out-of-domain). Third, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of supervised models for medical section segmentation with zero-shot large language models. Our results show that while supervised models perform strongly in-domain, their performance drops substantially out-of-domain. In contrast, zero-shot models demonstrate robust out-of-domain adaptability once hallucinated section headers are corrected. These findings underscore the importance of developing domain-specific clinical resources and highlight zero-shot segmentation as a promising direction for applying healthcare NLP beyond well-studied corpora, as long as hallucinations are appropriately managed."}

The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as \"forest\".

However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations."}

We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%.

Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility."}

Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information.

We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost.

We identify four distinct patterns of user interaction with agents -- hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover. Leveraging these insights, we train language models (LMs) to anticipate when users are likely to intervene based on their interaction styles, yielding a 61.4-63.4% improvement in intervention prediction accuracy over base LMs. Finally, we deploy these intervention-aware models in live web navigation agents and evaluate them in a user study, finding a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness.

However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion.

Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments.

While self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced ICD systems, existing view-level contrastive methods struggle with sophisticated edits due to insufficient fine-grained correspondence learning. We address this limitation by exploiting the inherent geometric traceability in edited content through two key innovations. First, we propose PixTrace - a pixel coordinate tracking module that maintains explicit spatial mappings across editing transformations. Second, we introduce CopyNCE, a geometrically-guided contrastive loss that regularizes patch affinity using overlap ratios derived from PixTrace's verified mappings. Our method bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate not only state-of-the-art performance (88.7% uAP / 83.9% RP90 for matcher, 72.6% uAP / 68.4% RP90 for descriptor on DISC21 dataset) but also better interpretability over existing methods."}

Based on this observation, we propose ${\\bf \\texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs).

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels."}

While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods."}

A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing."}

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice.

To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments.

In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices."}

At its core is an Intent State (IS) that maintains dual memory sets for positive anchors (confirmed cues) and negative constraints (rejected hypotheses). A contrastive alignment function ranks candidate objects by maximizing similarity to positive cues while penalizing rejected ones, enabling fine-grained disambiguation in cluttered scenes. Our interactive framework provides substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy without additional supervision.

Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data. All code, human behavioral data, and experimental stimuli needed to reproduce our findings can be found on our project page."}

When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model.
