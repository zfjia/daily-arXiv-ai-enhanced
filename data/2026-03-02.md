Abstract: Graphic layouts serve as an important and engaging medium for visual communication across different channels. While recent layout generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities, they frequently fail to align with nuanced human aesthetic judgment. Existing preference datasets and reward models trained on text-to-image generation do not generalize to layout evaluation, where the spatial arrangement of identical elements determines quality. To address this critical gap, we introduce DesignSense-10k, a large-scale dataset of 10,235 human-annotated preference pairs for graphic layout evaluation. We propose a five-stage curation pipeline that generates visually coherent layout transformations across diverse aspect ratios, using semantic grouping, layout prediction, filtering, clustering, and VLM-based refinement to produce high-quality comparison pairs. Human preferences are annotated using a 4-class scheme (left, right, both good, both bad) to capture subjective ambiguity. Leveraging this dataset, we train DesignSense, a vision-language model-based classifier that substantially outperforms existing open-source and proprietary models across comprehensive evaluation metrics (54.6% improvement in Macro F1 over the strongest proprietary baseline). Our analysis shows that frontier VLMs remain unreliable overall and fail catastrophically on the full four-class task, underscoring the need for specialized, preference-aware models. Beyond the dataset, our reward model DesignSense yields tangible downstream gains in layout generation. Using our judge during RL based training improves generator win rate by about 3%, while inference-time scaling, which involves generating multiple candidates and selecting the best one, provides a 3.6% improvement. These results highlight the practical impact of specialized, layout-aware preference modeling on real-world layout generation quality.

Abstract: Limitations on the availability of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) present a fundamental challenge to researchers of neuromorphic computer vision applications. In response, datasets have been created by the research community, but often contain a limited number of samples or scenarios. To address the lack of a comprehensive simulator of neuromorphic vision datasets, we introduce the Anomalous Neuromorphic Tool for Shapes (ANTShapes), a novel dataset simulation framework. Built in the Unity engine, ANTShapes simulates abstract, configurable 3D scenes populated by objects displaying randomly-generated behaviours describing attributes such as motion and rotation. The sampling of object behaviours, and the labelling of anomalously-acting objects, is a statistical process following central limit theorem principles. Datasets containing an arbitrary number of samples can be created and exported from ANTShapes, along with accompanying label and frame data, through the adjustment of a limited number of parameters within the software. ANTShapes addresses the limitations of data availability to researchers of event-based computer vision by allowing for the simulation of bespoke datasets to suit purposes including object recognition and localisation alongside anomaly detection.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deepfake technology, malicious face manipulations pose a significant threat to personal privacy and social security. However, existing proactive forensics methods typically treat deepfake detection, tampering localization, and source tracing as independent tasks, lacking a unified framework to address them jointly. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified proactive forensics framework that jointly addresses these three core tasks. Our core framework adopts an innovative 152-dimensional landmark-identity watermark termed LIDMark, which structurally interweaves facial landmarks with a unique source identifier. To robustly extract the LIDMark, we design a novel Factorized-Head Decoder (FHD). Its architecture factorizes the shared backbone features into two specialized heads (i.e., regression and classification), robustly reconstructing the embedded landmarks and identifier, respectively, even when subjected to severe distortion or tampering. This design realizes an "all-in-one" trifunctional forensic solution: the regression head underlies an "intrinsic-extrinsic" consistency check for detection and localization, while the classification head robustly decodes the source identifier for tracing. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LIDMark framework provides a unified, robust, and imperceptible solution for the detection, localization, and tracing of deepfake content. The code is available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/LIDMark.

Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Visual Genome 2 (SVG2), a large-scale panoptic video scene graph dataset. SVG2 contains over 636K videos with 6.6M objects, 52.0M attributes, and 6.7M relations, providing an order-of-magnitude increase in scale and diversity over prior spatio-temporal scene graph datasets. To create SVG2, we design a fully automated pipeline that combines multi-scale panoptic segmentation, online-offline trajectory tracking with automatic new-object discovery, per-trajectory semantic parsing, and GPT-5-based spatio-temporal relation inference. Building on this resource, we train TRaSER, a video scene graph generation model. TRaSER augments VLMs with a trajectory-aligned token arrangement mechanism and new modules: an object-trajectory resampler and a temporal-window resampler to convert raw videos and panoptic trajectories into compact spatio-temporal scene graphs in a single forward pass. The temporal-window resampler binds visual tokens to short trajectory segments to preserve local motion and temporal semantics, while the object-trajectory resampler aggregates entire trajectories to maintain global context for objects. On the PVSG, VIPSeg, VidOR and SVG2 test datasets, TRaSER improves relation detection by +15 to 20%, object prediction by +30 to 40% over the strongest open-source baselines and by +13% over GPT-5, and attribute prediction by +15%. When TRaSER's generated scene graphs are sent to a VLM for video question answering, it delivers a +1.5 to 4.6% absolute accuracy gain over using video only or video augmented with Qwen2.5-VL's generated scene graphs, demonstrating the utility of explicit spatio-temporal scene graphs as an intermediate representation.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches to long-form video question answering (LVQA) have demonstrated significant accuracy improvements by grounding temporal reasoning in formal verification. However, existing methods incur prohibitive latency overheads, up to 90x slower than base VLM prompting, rendering them impractical for latency-sensitive edge deployments. We present LE-NeuS, a latency-efficient neuro-symbolic framework that preserves the accuracy benefits of temporal logic-guided video understanding while drastically reducing inference latency. Our key insight is that the dominant computational bottleneck arises from sequential and dense proposition detection across video frames during automaton construction. We address this through two principled optimizations: (1) CLIP guided two-stage adaptive sampling that exploits visual redundancy to skip semantically similar frames while preserving temporal boundaries, and (2) batched proposition detection that parallelizes VLM inference across temporal windows. Theoretically, we derive latency bounds as a function of video length, proposition complexity, and sampling density, establishing conditions under which latency efficiency is achievable. Empirically, on LongVideoBench and Video-MME benchmarks deployed on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, LE-NeuS reduces the latency gap from 90x to approximately 10x while maintaining >10% accuracy gains on temporally complex queries.

Abstract: We present the first study of cross-sensor view synthesis across different modalities. We examine a practical, fundamental, yet widely overlooked problem: getting aligned RGB-X data, where most RGB-X prior work assumes such pairs exist and focuses on modality fusion, but it empirically requires huge engineering effort in calibration. We propose a match-densify-consolidate method. First, we perform RGB-X image matching followed by guided point densification. Using the proposed confidence-aware densification and self-matching filtering, we attain better view synthesis and later consolidate them in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method uses no 3D priors for X-sensor and only assumes nearly no-cost COLMAP for RGB. We aim to remove the cumbersome calibration for various RGB-X sensors and advance the popularity of cross-sensor learning by a scalable solution that breaks through the bottleneck in large-scale real-world RGB-X data collection.

Abstract: Understanding sources of uncertainty is fundamental to trustworthy three-dimensional scene modeling. While recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve impressive accuracy in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, the lack of uncertainty estimation significantly limits their deployment in safety-critical settings. Existing uncertainty quantification methods for NeRFs fail to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Among those that do quantify one or the other, many of them either compromise rendering quality or incur significant computational overhead to obtain uncertainty estimates. To address these issues, we introduce Evidential Neural Radiance Fields, a probabilistic approach that seamlessly integrates with the NeRF rendering process and enables direct quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from a single forward pass. We compare multiple uncertainty quantification methods on three standardized benchmarks, where our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art scene reconstruction fidelity and uncertainty estimation quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transforming image features from perspective view (PV) space to bird's-eye-view (BEV) space remains challenging in autonomous driving due to depth ambiguity and occlusion. Although several view transformation (VT) paradigms have been proposed, the challenge still remains. In this paper, we propose a new regularization framework, dubbed CycleBEV, that enhances existing VT models for BEV semantic segmentation. Inspired by cycle consistency, widely used in image distribution modeling, we devise an inverse view transformation (IVT) network that maps BEV segmentation maps back to PV segmentation maps and use it to regularize VT networks during training through cycle consistency losses, enabling them to capture richer semantic and geometric information from input PV images. To further exploit the capacity of the IVT network, we introduce two novel ideas that extend cycle consistency into geometric and representation spaces. We evaluate CycleBEV on four representative VT models covering three major paradigms using the large-scale nuScenes dataset. Experimental results show consistent improvements -- with gains of up to 0.74, 4.86, and 3.74 mIoU for drivable area, vehicle, and pedestrian classes, respectively -- without increasing inference complexity, since the IVT network is used only during training. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/JeongbinHong/CycleBEV.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large unimodal foundation models for vision and language encode rich semantic structures, yet aligning them typically requires computationally intensive multimodal fine-tuning. Such approaches depend on large-scale parameter updates, are resource intensive, and can perturb pretrained representations. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that independently trained foundation models may already exhibit latent semantic compatibility, reflecting shared structures in the data they model. This raises a fundamental question: can cross-modal alignment be achieved without modifying the models themselves? Here we introduce HDFLIM (HyperDimensional computing with Frozen Language and Image Models), a framework that establishes cross-modal mappings while keeping pretrained vision and language models fully frozen. HDFLIM projects unimodal embeddings into a shared hyperdimensional space and leverages lightweight symbolic operations -- binding, bundling, and similarity-based retrieval to construct associative cross-modal representations in a single pass over the data. Caption generation emerges from high-dimensional memory retrieval rather than iterative gradient-based optimization. We show that HDFLIM achieves performance comparable to end-to-end vision-language training methods and produces captions that are more semantically grounded than zero-shot baselines. By decoupling alignment from parameter tuning, our results suggest that semantic mapping across foundation models can be realized through symbolic operations on hyperdimensional encodings of the respective embeddings. More broadly, this work points toward an alternative paradigm for foundation model alignment in which frozen models are integrated through structured representational mappings rather than through large-scale retraining. The codebase for our implementation can be found at https://github.com/Abhishek-Dalvi410/HDFLIM.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent multimodal models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have shown remarkable ability to align visual and linguistic representations. However, domains where small visual differences carry large semantic significance, such as diagram understanding, remain challenging due to the models' limited sensitivity to fine-grained structural variations.
  We propose a new training paradigm designed to enhance diagram comprehension in vision-language models. Our approach introduces pseudo contrastive samples generated by a diagram renderer that creates synthetic diagrams using randomly picked text elements. These samples highlight structural differences in diagrammatic imagery without requiring any modification or editing of the original data. By incorporating these pseudo contrastive samples into the training objective, the model learns to capture more precise and semantically consistent diagram structures.
  Empirical evaluations on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts demonstrate substantial improvements over standard CLIP and hard-negative CLIP training in both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. The results underscore the value of domain-specific training strategies and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader context of vision-language learning.

Abstract: While nowadays visual anomaly detection algorithms use deep neural networks to extract salient features from images, the high dimensionality of extracted features makes it difficult to apply those algorithms to large data with 1000s of images. To address this issue, we present an incremental dimension reduction algorithm to reduce the extracted features. While our algorithm essentially computes truncated singular value decomposition of these features, other than processing all vectors at once, our algorithm groups the vectors into batches. At each batch, our algorithm updates the truncated singular values and vectors that represent all visited vectors, and reduces each batch by its own singular values and vectors so they can be stored in the memory with low overhead. After processing all batches, we re-transform these batch-wise singular vectors to the space spanned by the singular vectors of all features. We show that our algorithm can accelerate the training of state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithm with close accuracy.

Abstract: Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) struggle with high-resolution visual inputs during the reasoning process, as the number of image tokens increases quadratically with resolution, introducing substantial redundancy and irrelevant information. A common practice is to identify key image regions and refer to their high-resolution counterparts during reasoning, typically trained with external visual supervision. However, such visual supervision cues require costly grounding labels from human annotators. Meanwhile, it remains an open question how to enhance a model's grounding abilities to support reasoning without relying on additional annotations. In this paper, we propose High-resolution Annotation-free Reasoning Technique (HART), a closed-loop framework that enables LMMs to focus on and self-verify key regions of high-resolution visual inputs. HART incorporates a post-training paradigm in which we design Advantage Preference Group Relative Policy Optimization (AP-GRPO) to encourage accurate localization of key regions. Notably, HART provides explainable reasoning pathways and enables efficient optimization of localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HART improves performance across a wide range of high-resolution visual tasks, consistently outperforming strong baselines. When applied to post-train Qwen2.5-VL-7B, HART even surpasses larger-scale models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B and LLaVA-OneVision-72B on high-resolution, vision-centric benchmarks.

Abstract: Egocentric human pose estimation (HPE) using a head-mounted device is crucial for various VR and AR applications, but it faces significant challenges due to keypoint invisibility. Nevertheless, none of the existing egocentric HPE datasets provide keypoint visibility annotations, and the existing methods often overlook the invisibility problem, treating visible and invisible keypoints indiscriminately during estimation. As a result, their capacity to accurately predict visible keypoints is compromised. In this paper, we first present Eva-3M, a large-scale egocentric visibility-aware HPE dataset comprising over 3.0M frames, with 435K of them annotated with keypoint visibility labels. Additionally, we augment the existing EMHI dataset with keypoint visibility annotations to further facilitate the research in this direction. Furthermore, we propose EvaPose, a novel egocentric visibility-aware HPE method that explicitly incorporates visibility information to enhance pose estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the significant value of ground-truth visibility labels in egocentric HPE settings, and demonstrate that our EvaPose achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Eva-3M and EMHI datasets.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in the field of Instruction-based Image Editing Models (IIEMs). However, while these models demonstrate plausible adherence to instructions and strong reasoning ability on current benchmarks, their ability to edit small objects remains underexplored, despite its importance for precise local editing and refining details in both real and generated images. In this paper, we introduce DeepLookEditBench (DLEBench), the first benchmark dedicated to assessing the abilities of IIEMs in editing small-scale objects. Specifically, we construct a challenging testbed comprising 1889 samples across seven instruction types. In these samples, target objects occupy only 1%-10% of the image area, covering complex scenarios such as partial occlusion and multi-object editing. To ensure robust evaluation on this benchmark, we propose an evaluation protocol with refined score rubrics to minimize subjectivity and ambiguity in two criteria: Instruction Following and Visual Consistency. This protocol also introduces a dual-mode evaluation framework (Tool-driven and Oracle-guided Modes) addressing the misalignment between LMM-as-a-Judge and human judgements on DLEBench. Empirical results on 10 IIEMs reveal significant performance gaps in small-scale object editing, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks to advance this ability.

Abstract: We introduce BuildAnyPoint, a novel generative framework for structured 3D building reconstruction from point clouds with diverse distributions, such as those captured by airborne LiDAR and Structure-from-Motion. To recover artist-created building abstraction in this highly underconstrained setting, we capitalize on the role of explicit 3D generative priors in autoregressive mesh generation. Specifically, we design a Loosely Cascaded Diffusion Transformer (Loca-DiT) that initially recovers the underlying distribution from noisy or sparse points, followed by autoregressively encapsulating them into compact meshes. We first formulate distribution recovery as a conditional generation task by training latent diffusion models conditioned on input point clouds, and then tailor a decoder-only transformer for conditional autoregressive mesh generation based on the recovered point clouds. Our method delivers substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements over prior building abstraction methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our approach is evidenced by the strong performance of its recovered point clouds on building point cloud completion benchmarks, which exhibit improved surface accuracy and distribution uniformity.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show strong potential for complex diagnostic tasks in medical imaging. However, applying VLMs to multi-organ medical imaging introduces two principal challenges: (1) modality-specific vision-language alignment and (2) cross-modal feature fusion. In this work, we propose MedMAP, a Medical Modality-Aware Pretraining framework that enhances vision-language representation learning in 3D MRI. MedMAP comprises a modality-aware vision-language alignment stage and a fine-tuning stage for multi-organ abnormality detection. During the pre-training stage, the modality-aware encoders implicitly capture the joint modality distribution and improve alignment between visual and textual representations. We then fine-tune the pre-trained vision encoders (while keeping the text encoder frozen) for downstream tasks. To this end, we curated MedMoM-MRI3D, comprising 7,392 3D MRI volume-report pairs spanning twelve MRI modalities and nine abnormalities tailored for various 3D medical analysis tasks. Extensive experiments on MedMoM-MRI3D demonstrate that MedMAP significantly outperforms existing VLMs in 3D MRI-based multi-organ abnormality detection.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot recognition, yet their real-world deployment is challenged by distribution shifts. While Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) can mitigate this, existing VLM-based TTA methods operate under a closed-set assumption, failing in open-set scenarios where test streams contain both covariate-shifted in-distribution (csID) and out-of-distribution (csOOD) data. This leads to a critical difficulty: the model must discriminate unknown csOOD samples to avoid interference while simultaneously adapting to known csID classes for accuracy. Current open-set TTA (OSTTA) methods rely on hard thresholds for separation and entropy minimization for adaptation. These strategies are brittle, often misclassifying ambiguous csOOD samples and inducing overconfident predictions, and their parameter-update mechanism is computationally prohibitive for VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Double-Check Separation (ProtoDCS), a robust framework for OSTTA that effectively separates csID and csOOD samples, enabling safe and efficient adaptation of VLMs to csID data. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel double-check separation mechanism employing probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) verification to replace brittle thresholding; and (2) an evidence-driven adaptation strategy utilizing uncertainty-aware loss and efficient prototype-level updates, mitigating overconfidence and reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100-C and Tiny-ImageNet-C demonstrate that ProtoDCS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly boosting both known-class accuracy and OOD detection metrics.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation using vision-language models (VLMs) is limited by the risk of prior-comparison hallucination, where the model generates historical findings unsupported by the current study. We address this challenge with a training-free, inference-time control framework termed Semantically Decoupled Latent Steering (SDLS). Unlike generic activation steering, which often suffers from semantic entanglement, our approach constructs a semantic-free intervention vector via large language model (LLM)-driven semantic decomposition followed by $QR$-based orthogonalization. This orthogonalization step is critical. It leverages geometric constraints to filter out the clinical semantics often entangled in standard principal component analysis (PCA) directions, ensuring that the steering vector targets only the ``historical comparison" axis. We validate our method on the BiomedGPT foundation model, demonstrating that it overcomes the trade-off between hallucination suppression and clinical accuracy. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, and zero-shot transfer evaluation on CheXpert Plus and IU-Xray, demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Quantitative evaluations on MIMIC-CXR show that our approach significantly reduces the probability of historical hallucinations (FilBERT score decreases from 0.2373 to 0.1889) and improves clinical label fidelity (CheXpert macro-F1 increases from 0.2242 to 0.3208). Supplementary evaluations confirm that the structural integrity of the clinical narrative is maintained.

Abstract: Fine-grained crop-weed segmentation is essential for enabling targeted herbicide application in precision agriculture. However, existing deep learning models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous agricultural environments due to reliance on dataset-specific visual features. We propose Vision-Language Weed Segmentation (VL-WS), a novel framework that addresses this limitation by grounding pixel-level segmentation in semantically aligned, domain-invariant representations. Our architecture employs a dual-encoder design, where frozen Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embeddings and task-specific spatial features are fused and modulated via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers conditioned on natural language captions. This design enables image level textual descriptions to guide channel-wise feature refinement while preserving fine-grained spatial localization. Unlike prior works restricted to training and evaluation on single-source datasets, VL-WS is trained on a unified corpus that includes close-range ground imagery (robotic platforms) and high-altitude UAV imagery, covering diverse crop types, weed species, growth stages, and sensing conditions. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, with VL-WS achieving a mean Dice score of 91.64% and outperforming the CNN baseline by 4.98%. The largest gains occur on the most challenging weed class, where VL-WS attains 80.45% Dice score compared to 65.03% for the best baseline, representing a 15.42% improvement. VL-WS further maintains stable weed segmentation performance under limited target-domain supervision, indicating improved generalization and data efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of vision-language alignment to enable scalable, label-efficient segmentation models deployable across diverse real-world agricultural domains.

Abstract: The remote sensing community is witnessing a rapid growth of foundation models, which provide powerful embeddings for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, practical adoption and fair comparison remain challenging due to substantial heterogeneity in model release formats, platforms and interfaces, and input data specifications. These inconsistencies significantly increase the cost of obtaining, using, and benchmarking embeddings across models. To address this issue, we propose rs-embed, a Python library that offers a unified, region of interst (ROI) centric interface: with a single line of code, users can retrieve embeddings from any supported model for any location and any time range. The library also provides efficient batch processing to enable large-scale embedding generation and evaluation. The code is available at: https://github.com/cybergis/rs-embed

Abstract: Object swapping aims to replace a source object in a scene with a reference object while preserving object fidelity, scene fidelity, and object-scene harmony. Existing methods either require per-object finetuning and slow inference or rely on extra paired data that mostly depict the same object across contexts, forcing models to rely on background cues rather than learning cross-object alignment. We propose SourceSwap, a self-supervised and source-aware framework that learns cross-object alignment. Our key insight is to synthesize high-quality pseudo pairs from any image via a frequency-separated perturbation in the initial-noise space, which alters appearance while preserving pose, coarse shape, and scene layout, requiring no videos, multi-view data, or additional images. We then train a dual U-Net with full-source conditioning and a noise-free reference encoder, enabling direct inter-object alignment, zero-shot inference without per-object finetuning, and lightweight iterative refinement. We further introduce SourceBench, a high-quality benchmark with higher resolution, more categories, and richer interactions. Experiments demonstrate that SourceSwap achieves superior fidelity, stronger scene preservation, and more natural harmony, and it transfers well to edits such as subject-driven refinement and face swapping.

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of processing vision tokens in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hinders their widespread adoption. While progressive vision token pruning offers a promising solution, current methods misinterpret shallow layer functions and use rigid schedules, which fail to unlock the full efficiency potential. To address these issues, we propose HiDrop, a framework that aligns token pruning with the true hierarchical function of MLLM layers. HiDrop features two key innovations: (1) Late Injection, which bypasses passive shallow layers to introduce visual tokens exactly where active fusion begins; and (2) Concave Pyramid Pruning with an Early Exit mechanism to dynamically adjust pruning rates across middle and deep layers. This process is optimized via an inter-layer similarity measure and a differentiable top-k operator. To ensure practical efficiency, HiDrop further incorporates persistent positional encoding, FlashAttention-compatible token selection, and parallel decoupling of vision computation to eliminate hidden overhead associated with dynamic token reduction. Extensive experiments show that HiDrop compresses about 90% visual tokens while matching the original performance and accelerating training by 1.72 times. Our work not only sets a new state-of-the-art for efficient MLLM training and inference but also provides valuable insights into the hierarchical nature of multimodal fusion. The code is released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/HiDrop.

Abstract: Ultra-long egocentric videos spanning multiple days present significant challenges for video understanding. Existing approaches still rely on fragmented local processing and limited temporal modeling, restricting their ability to reason over such extended sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce EgoGraph, a training-free and dynamic knowledge-graph construction framework that explicitly encodes long-term, cross-entity dependencies in egocentric video streams. EgoGraph employs a novel egocentric schema that unifies the extraction and abstraction of core entities, such as people, objects, locations, and events, and structurally reasons about their attributes and interactions, yielding a significantly richer and more coherent semantic representation than traditional clip-based video models. Crucially, we develop a temporal relational modeling strategy that captures temporal dependencies across entities and accumulates stable long-term memory over multiple days, enabling complex temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments on the EgoLifeQA and EgoR1-bench benchmarks demonstrate that EgoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-term video question answering, validating its effectiveness as a new paradigm for ultra-long egocentric video understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (U-MLLMs) integrate understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, existing evaluations typically assess these capabilities separately, overlooking semantic equivalence, i.e., the ability to manifest consistent reasoning results regardless of the output modality. In this work, we investigate whether current U-MLLMs satisfy this premise. We observe that while models demonstrate robust textual reasoning, they fail to maintain semantic equivalence when required to render the same results in the image modality. To rigorously diagnose this discrepancy, we introduce VGUBench, a framework to decouple reasoning logic from generation fidelity. VGUBench comprises three diagnostic tasks: (1)Textual Generative Understanding, establishing a baseline for reasoning accuracy in textual response; (2)Visual Generative Understanding, evaluating the ability to generate visual responses that represent the correct answer; and (3)a Visual Rendering control task, which assesses the ability to directly render explicit visual descriptions into images without complex reasoning. Our evaluation reveals a significant disparity: despite strong performance in textual understanding and visual rendering, U-MLLMs exhibit a marked performance collapse when required to generate visual answers to questions. Furthermore, we find a negligible correlation between visual answering performance and basic rendering quality. These results suggest that the failure stems not from insufficient generation fidelity, but from a breakdown in cross-modal semantic alignment. We provide diagnostic insights to address this challenge in future Unified Generation and Understanding Models.

Abstract: Diffusion models are able to produce AI-generated images that are almost indistinguishable from real ones. This raises concerns about their potential misuse and poses substantial challenges for detecting them. Many existing detectors rely on reconstruction error -- the difference between the input image and its reconstructed version -- as the basis for distinguishing real from fake images. However, these detectors become less effective as modern AI-generated images become increasingly similar to real ones. To address this challenge, we propose a novel difference-in-difference method. Instead of directly using the reconstruction error (a first-order difference), we compute the difference in reconstruction error -- a second-order difference -- for variance reduction and improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong generalization performance, enabling reliable detection of AI-generated images in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: One-stream Transformer-based trackers achieve advanced performance in visual object tracking but suffer from significant computational overhead that hinders real-time deployment. While token pruning offers a path to efficiency, existing methods are fragmented. They typically prune the search region, dynamic template, and static template in isolation, overlooking critical inter-component dependencies, which yields suboptimal pruning and degraded accuracy. To address this, we introduce UTPTrack, a simple and Unified Token Pruning framework that, for the first time, jointly compresses all three components. UTPTrack employs an attention-guided, token type-aware strategy to holistically model redundancy, a design that seamlessly supports unified tracking across multimodal and language-guided tasks within a single model. Extensive evaluations on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that UTPTrack achieves a new state-of-the-art in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for pruning-based trackers, pruning 65.4% of vision tokens in RGB-based tracking and 67.5% in unified tracking while preserving 99.7% and 100.5% of baseline performance, respectively. This strong performance across both RGB and multimodal scenarios underlines its potential as a robust foundation for future research in efficient visual tracking. Code will be released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/UTPTrack.

Abstract: Full-stack multimodal interaction in real-time is a central goal in building intelligent embodied agents capable of natural, dynamic communication. However, existing systems are either limited to unimodal generation or suffer from degraded reasoning and poor cross-modal alignment, preventing coherent and perceptually grounded interactions. In this work, we introduce U-Mind, the first unified system for high-intelligence multimodal dialogue that supports real-time generation and jointly models language, speech, motion, and video synthesis within a single interactive loop. At its core, U-Mind implements a Unified Alignment and Reasoning Framework that addresses two key challenges: enhancing cross-modal synchronization via a segment-wise alignment strategy, and preserving reasoning abilities through Rehearsal-Driven Learning. During inference, U-Mind adopts a text-first decoding pipeline that performs internal chain-of-thought planning followed by temporally synchronized generation across modalities. To close the loop, we implement a real-time video rendering framework conditioned on pose and speech, enabling expressive and synchronized visual feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-Mind achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of multimodal interaction tasks, including question answering, instruction following, and motion generation, paving the way toward intelligent, immersive conversational agents.

Abstract: Accurately segmenting objects without any manual annotations remains one of the core challenges in computer vision. In this work, we introduce Selfment, a fully self-supervised framework that segments foreground objects directly from raw images without human labels, pretrained segmentation models, or any post-processing. Selfment first constructs patch-level affinity graphs from self-supervised features and applies NCut to obtain an initial coarse foreground--background separation. We then introduce Iterative Patch Optimization (IPO), a feature-space refinement procedure that progressively enforces spatial coherence and semantic consistency through iterative patch clustering. The refined masks are subsequently used as supervisory signals to train a lightweight segmentation head with contrastive and region-consistency objectives, allowing the model to learn stable and transferable object representations. Despite its simplicity and complete absence of manual supervision, Selfment sets new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across multiple benchmarks. It achieves substantial improvements on $F_{\max}$ over previous unsupervised saliency detection methods on ECSSD ($+4.0\%$), HKUIS ($+4.6\%$), and PASCAL-S ($+5.7\%$). Moreover, without any additional fine-tuning, Selfment demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to camouflaged object detection tasks (e.g., $0.910$ $S_m$ on CHAMELEON and $0.792$ $F_β^ω$ on CAMO), outperforming all existing unsupervised approaches and even rivaling the SoTA fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models lack an efficient mechanism for early quality assessment, leading to costly trial-and-error in multi-generation scenarios such as prompt iteration, agent-based generation, and flow-grpo. We reveal a strong correlation between early diffusion cross-attention distributions and final image quality. Based on this finding, we introduce Diffusion Probe, a framework that leverages internal cross-attention maps as predictive signals.
  We design a lightweight predictor that maps statistical properties of early-stage cross-attention extracted from initial denoising steps to the final image's overall quality. This enables accurate forecasting of image quality across diverse evaluation metrics long before full synthesis is complete.
  We validate Diffusion Probe across a wide range of settings. On multiple T2I models, across early denoising windows, resolutions, and quality metrics, it achieves strong correlation (PCC > 0.7) and high classification performance (AUC-ROC > 0.9).
  Its reliability translates into practical gains. By enabling early quality-aware decisions in workflows such as prompt optimization, seed selection, and accelerated RL training, the probe supports more targeted sampling and avoids computation on low-potential generations. This reduces computational overhead while improving final output quality.
  Diffusion Probe is model-agnostic, efficient, and broadly applicable, offering a practical solution for improving T2I generation efficiency through early quality prediction.

Abstract: In remote sensing rotated object detection, mainstream methods suffer from two bottlenecks, directional incoherence at detector neck and task conflict at detecting head. Ulitising fourier rotation equivariance, we introduce Fourier Angle Alignment, which analyses angle information through frequency spectrum and aligns the main direction to a certain orientation. Then we propose two plug and play modules : FAAFusion and FAA Head. FAAFusion works at the detector neck, aligning the main direction of higher-level features to the lower-level features and then fusing them. FAA Head serves as a new detection head, which pre-aligns RoI features to a canonical angle and adds them to the original features before classification and regression. Experiments on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016 show that our method can greatly improve previous work. Particularly, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results of 78.72% mAP on DOTA-v1.0 and 72.28% mAP on DOTA-v1.5 datasets with single scale training and testing, validating the efficacy of our approach in remote sensing object detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained perception models excel in generic image domains but degrade significantly in novel environments like indoor scenes. The conventional remedy is fine-tuning on downstream data which incurs catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge and demands costly, scene-specific annotations. We propose a paradigm shift through Sea$^2$ (See, Act, Adapt): rather than adapting the perception modules themselves, we adapt how they are deployed through an intelligent pose-control agent. Sea$^2$ keeps all perception modules frozen, requiring no downstream labels during training, and uses only scalar perceptual feedback to navigate the agent toward informative viewpoints. Specially, we transform a vision-language model (VLM) into a low-level pose controller through a two-stage training pipeline: first fine-tuning it on rule-based exploration trajectories that systematically probe indoor scenes, and then refining the policy via unsupervised reinforcement learning that constructs rewards from the perception module's outputs and confidence. Unlike prior active perception methods that couple exploration with specific models or collect data for retraining them, Sea$^2$ directly leverages off-the-shelf perception models for various tasks without the need for retraining. We conducted experiments on three visual perception tasks, including visual grounding, segmentation and 3D box estimation, with performance improvements of 13.54%, 15.92% and 27.68% respectively on dataset ReplicaCAD.

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation requires policies that can reason about 3D geometry, anticipate how it evolves under action, and generate smooth, coordinated motions. However, existing methods typically rely on 2D features with limited spatial awareness, or require explicit point clouds that are difficult to obtain reliably in real-world settings. At the same time, recent 3D geometric foundation models show that accurate and diverse 3D structure can be reconstructed directly from RGB images in a fast and robust manner. We leverage this opportunity and propose a framework that builds bimanual manipulation directly on a pre-trained 3D geometric foundation model. Our policy fuses geometry-aware latents, 2D semantic features, and proprioception into a unified state representation, and uses diffusion model to jointly predict a future action chunk and a future 3D latent that decodes into a dense pointmap. By explicitly predicting how the 3D scene will evolve together with the action sequence, the policy gains strong spatial understanding and predictive capability using only RGB observations. We evaluate our method both in simulation on the RoboTwin benchmark and in real-world robot executions. Our approach consistently outperforms 2D-based and point-cloud-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in manipulation success, inter-arm coordination, and 3D spatial prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Rapid progress in vision-language modeling has enabled pathology report generation from gigapixel whole-slide images, but most approaches assume static training with simultaneous access to all data. In clinical deployment, however, new organs, institutions, and reporting conventions emerge over time, and sequential fine-tuning can cause catastrophic forgetting. We introduce an exemplar-free continual learning framework for WSI-to-report generation that avoids storing raw slides or patch exemplars. The core idea is a compact domain footprint built in a frozen patch-embedding space: a small codebook of representative morphology tokens together with slide-level co-occurrence summaries and lightweight patch-count priors. These footprints support generative replay by synthesizing pseudo-WSI representations that reflect domain-specific morphological mixtures, while a teacher snapshot provides pseudo-reports to supervise the updated model without retaining past data. To address shifting reporting conventions, we distill domain-specific linguistic characteristics into a compact style descriptor and use it to steer generation. At inference, the model identifies the most compatible descriptor directly from the slide signal, enabling domain-agnostic setup without requiring explicit domain identifiers. Evaluated across multiple public continual learning benchmarks, our approach outperforms exemplar-free and limited-buffer rehearsal baselines, highlighting footprint-based generative replay as a practical solution for deployment in evolving clinical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has become a key modality for ship detection. However, robust performance remains challenging in complex scenes, where clutter and speckle noise can induce false alarms and small targets are easily missed. To address these issues, we propose CPN-YOLO, a high-precision ship detection framework built upon YOLOv8 with three targeted improvements. First, we introduce a learnable large-kernel denoising module for input pre-processing, producing cleaner representations and more discriminative features across diverse ship types. Second, we design a feature extraction enhancement strategy based on the PPA attention mechanism to strengthen multi-scale modeling and improve sensitivity to small ships. Third, we incorporate a Gaussian similarity loss derived from the normalized Wasserstein distance (NWD) to better measure similarity under complex bounding-box distributions and improve generalization. Extensive experiments on HRSID and SSDD demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SSDD, CPN-YOLO surpasses the YOLOv8 baseline, achieving 97.0% precision, 95.1% recall, and 98.9% mAP, and consistently outperforms other representative deep-learning detectors in overall performance.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) links language to region level visual perception. Standard benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg) have progressed rapidly with multimodal LLMs but remain weak tests of visual reasoning and grounding: (i) many expressions are very short, leaving little reasoning demand; (ii) images often contain few distractors, making the target easy to find; and (iii) redundant descriptors enable shortcut solutions that bypass genuine text understanding and visual reasoning. We introduce Ref-Adv, a modern REC benchmark that suppresses shortcuts by pairing linguistically nontrivial expressions with only the information necessary to uniquely identify the target. The dataset contains referring expressions on real images, curated with hard distractors and annotated with reasoning facets including negation. We conduct comprehensive ablations (word order perturbations and descriptor deletion sufficiency) to show that solving Ref-Adv requires reasoning beyond simple cues, and we evaluate a broad suite of contemporary multimodal LLMs on Ref-Adv. Despite strong results on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, models drop markedly on Ref-Adv, revealing reliance on shortcuts and gaps in visual reasoning and grounding. We provide an in depth failure analysis and aim for Ref-Adv to guide future work on visual reasoning and grounding in MLLMs.

Abstract: Complex video reasoning, actually, relies excessively on fine-grained perception rather than on expert (e.g., Ph.D, Science)-level reasoning. Through extensive empirical observation, we have recognized the critical impact of perception. In particular, when perception ability is almost fixed, enhancing reasoning from Qwen3-8B to OpenAI-o3 yields only 0.7% performance improvement. Conversely, even minimal change in perception model scale (from 7B to 32B) boosts performance by 1.4%, indicating enhancing perception, rather than reasoning, is more critical to improve performance. Therefore, exploring how to enhance perception ability through reasoning without the need for expensive fine-grained annotation information is worthwhile. To achieve this goal, we specially propose APPO, the Attention-guided Perception Policy Optimization algorithm that leverages token-level dense rewards to improve model's fine-grained perception. The core idea behind APPO is to optimize those tokens from different responses that primarily focus on the same crucial video frame (called intra-group perception tokens). Experimental results on diverse video benchmarks and models with different scales (3/7B) demonstrate APPO consistently outperforms GRPO and DAPO (0.5%~4%). We hope our work provides a promising approach to effectively enhance model's perception abilities through reasoning in a low-cost manner, serving diverse scenarios and demands.

Abstract: The expansion of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multimodal domains has intensified the challenge for processing complex visual documents, such as financial reports. While page-level chunking and retrieval is a natural starting point, it creates a critical bottleneck: delivering entire pages to the generator introduces excessive extraneous context. This not only overloads the generator's attention mechanism but also dilutes the most salient evidence. Moreover, compressing these information-rich pages into a limited visual token budget further increases the risk of hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AgenticOCR, a dynamic parsing paradigm that transforms optical character recognition (OCR) from a static, full-text process into a query-driven, on-demand extraction system. By autonomously analyzing document layout in a "thinking with images" manner, AgenticOCR identifies and selectively recognizes regions of interest. This approach performs on-demand decompression of visual tokens precisely where needed, effectively decoupling retrieval granularity from rigid page-level chunking. AgenticOCR has the potential to serve as the "third building block" of the visual document RAG stack, operating alongside and enhancing standard Embedding and Reranking modules. Experimental results demonstrate that AgenticOCR improves both the efficiency and accuracy of visual RAG systems, achieving expert-level performance in long document understanding. Code and models are available at https://github.com/OpenDataLab/AgenticOCR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ReSeg-CLIP, a new training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation method for remote sensing data. To compensate for the problems of vision language models, such as CLIP in semantic segmentation caused by inappropriate interactions within the self-attention layers, we introduce a hierarchical scheme utilizing masks generated by SAM to constrain the interactions at multiple scales. We also present a model composition approach that averages the parameters of multiple RS-specific CLIP variants, taking advantage of a new weighting scheme that evaluates representational quality using varying text prompts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across three RS benchmarks without additional training.

Abstract: A key challenge for autonomous driving lies in maintaining real-time situational awareness regarding surrounding obstacles under strict latency constraints. The high processing requirements coupled with limited onboard computational resources can cause delay issues, particularly in complex urban settings. To address this, we propose leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to partially offload processing to the cloud, where compute resources are abundant, thus reducing overall latency. Our approach utilizes transformer-based models to fuse multi-camera sensor data into a comprehensive Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation, enabling accurate 360-degree 3D object detection. The computation is dynamically split between the vehicle and the cloud based on the number of layers processed locally and the quantization level of the features. To further reduce network load, we apply feature vector clipping and compression prior to transmission. In a real-world experimental evaluation, our hybrid strategy achieved a 72 \% reduction in end-to-end latency compared to a traditional onboard solution. To adapt to fluctuating network conditions, we introduce a dynamic optimization algorithm that selects the split point and quantization level to maximize detection accuracy while satisfying real-time latency constraints. Trace-based evaluation under realistic bandwidth variability shows that this adaptive approach improves accuracy by up to 20 \% over static parameterization with the same latency performance.

Abstract: To address the challenge of aerial visual place recognition (VPR) problem under significant altitude variations, this study proposes an altitude-adaptive VPR approach that integrates ground feature density analysis with image classification techniques. The proposed method estimates airborne platforms' relative altitude by analyzing the density of ground features in images, then applies relative altitude-based cropping to generate canonical query images, which are subsequently used in a classification-based VPR strategy for localization. Extensive experiments across diverse terrains and altitude conditions demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy and robustness in both altitude estimation and VPR under significant altitude changes. Compared to conventional methods relying on barometric altimeters or Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, this solution requires no additional hardware and offers a plug-and-play solution for downstream applications, {making it suitable for small- and medium-sized airborne platforms operating in diverse environments, including rural and urban areas.} Under significant altitude variations, incorporating our relative altitude estimation module into the VPR retrieval pipeline boosts average R@1 and R@5 by 29.85\% and 60.20\%, respectively, compared with applying VPR retrieval alone. Furthermore, compared to traditional {Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) methods}, the proposed method reduces the mean error by 202.1 m, yielding average additional improvements of 31.4\% in R@1 and 44\% in R@5. These results demonstrate that our method establishes a robust, vision-only framework for three-dimensional visual place recognition, offering a practical and scalable solution for accurate airborne platforms localization under large altitude variations and limited sensor availability.

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown excellent ability in addressing image super-resolution in real-world scenarios by leveraging language class as condition information, yet their abilities in degraded images remain limited. In this paper, we first revisit the capabilities of the Recognize Anything Model (RAM) for degraded images by calculating text similarity. We find that directly using contrastive learning to fine-tune RAM in the degraded space is difficult to achieve acceptable results. To address this issue, we employ a degradation selection strategy to propose a Real Embedding Extractor (REE), which achieves significant recognition performance gain on degraded image content through contrastive learning. Furthermore, we use a Conditional Feature Modulator (CFM) to incorporate the high-level information of REE for a powerful Mamba-based network, which can leverage effective pixel information to restore image textures and produce visually pleasing results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the REE can effectively help image super-resolution networks balance fidelity and perceptual quality, highlighting the great potential of Mamba in real-world applications.

Abstract: Embodied foundation models require large-scale, high-quality real-world interaction data for pre-training and scaling. However, existing data collection methods suffer from high infrastructure costs, complex hardware dependencies, and limited interaction scope, making scalable expansion challenging. In fact, humans themselves are ideal physically embodied agents. Therefore, obtaining egocentric real-world interaction data from globally distributed "human agents" offers advantages of low cost and sustainability. To this end, we propose the Always-on Egocentric (AoE) data collection system, which aims to simplify hardware dependencies by leveraging humans themselves and their smartphones, enabling low-cost, highly efficient, and scene-agnostic real-world interaction data collection to address the challenge of data scarcity. Specifically, we first employ an ergonomic neck-mounted smartphone holder to enable low-barrier, large-scale egocentric data collection through a cloud-edge collaborative architecture. Second, we develop a cross-platform mobile APP that leverages on-device compute for real-time processing, while the cloud hosts automated labeling and filtering pipelines that transform raw videos into high-quality training data. Finally, the AoE system supports distributed Ego video data collection by anyone, anytime, and anywhere. We evaluate AoE on data preprocessing quality and downstream tasks, demonstrating that high-quality egocentric data significantly boosts real-world generalization.

Abstract: Estimating 3D occupancy and motion at the vehicle's surroundings is essential for autonomous driving, enabling situational awareness in dynamic environments. Existing approaches jointly learn geometry and motion but rely on expensive 3D occupancy and flow annotations, velocity labels from bounding boxes, or pretrained optical flow models. We propose a self-supervised method for 3D occupancy flow estimation that eliminates the need for human-produced annotations or external flow supervision. Our method disentangles the scene into separate static and dynamic signed distance fields and learns motion implicitly through temporal aggregation. Additionally, we introduce a strong self-supervised flow cue derived from features' cosine similarities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our 3D occupancy flow method on SemanticKITTI, KITTI-MOT, and nuScenes.

Abstract: We propose an experience-guided cascaded multi-agent framework for Breast Ultrasound Screening and Diagnosis, called BUSD-Agent, that aims to reduce diagnostic escalation and unnecessary biopsy referrals. Our framework models screening and diagnosis as a two-stage, selective decision-making process. A lightweight `screening clinic' agent, restricted to classification models as tools, selectively filters out benign and normal cases from further diagnostic escalation when malignancy risk and uncertainty are estimated as low. Cases that have higher risks are escalated to the `diagnostic clinic' agent, which integrates richer perception and radiological description tools to make a secondary decision on biopsy referral. To improve agent performance, past records of pathology-confirmed outcomes along with image embeddings, model predictions, and historical agent actions are stored in a memory bank as structured decision trajectories. For each new case, BUSD-Agent retrieves similar past cases based on image, model response and confidence similarity to condition the agent's current decision policy. This enables retrieval-conditioned in-context adaptation that dynamically adjusts model trust and escalation thresholds from prior experiences without parameter updates. Evaluation across 10 breast ultrasound datasets shows that the proposed experience-guided workflow reduces diagnostic escalation in BUSD-Agent from 84.95% to 58.72% and overall biopsy referrals from 59.50% to 37.08%, compared to the same architecture without trajectory conditioning, while improving average screening specificity by 68.48% and diagnostic specificity by 6.33%.

Abstract: State-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation achieve excellent accuracy but require substantial computational resources, limiting deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings. We present SegMate, an efficient 2.5D framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while considerably reducing computational requirements. Our efficient design is the result of meticulously integrating asymmetric architectures, attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature fusion, slice-based positional conditioning, and multi-task optimization. We demonstrate the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of our framework across three modern backbones (EfficientNetV2-M, MambaOut-Tiny, FastViT-T12). We perform experiments on three datasets: TotalSegmentator, SegTHOR and AMOS22. Compared with the vanilla models, SegMate reduces computation (GFLOPs) by up to 2.5x and memory footprint (VRAM) by up to 2.1x, while generally registering performance gains of around 1%. On TotalSegmentator, we achieve a Dice score of 93.51% with only 295MB peak GPU memory. Zero-shot cross-dataset evaluations on SegTHOR and AMOS22 demonstrate strong generalization, with Dice scores of up to 86.85% and 89.35%, respectively. We release our open-source code at https://github.com/andreibunea99/SegMate.

Abstract: When a text description is extended with an additional detail, image-text similarity should drop if that detail is wrong. We show that CLIP-style dual encoders often violate this intuition: appending a plausible but incorrect object or relation to an otherwise correct description can increase the similarity score. We call such cases half-truths. On COCO, CLIP prefers the correct shorter description only 40.6% of the time, and performance drops to 32.9% when the added detail is a relation. We trace this vulnerability to weak supervision on caption parts: contrastive training aligns full sentences but does not explicitly enforce that individual entities and relations are grounded. We propose CS-CLIP (Component-Supervised CLIP), which decomposes captions into entity and relation units, constructs a minimally edited foil for each unit, and fine-tunes the model to score the correct unit above its foil while preserving standard dual-encoder inference. CS-CLIP raises half-truth accuracy to 69.3% and improves average performance on established compositional benchmarks by 5.7 points, suggesting that reducing half-truth errors aligns with broader gains in compositional understanding.

Abstract: Neural implicit surface reconstruction with signed distance function has made significant progress, but recovering fine details such as thin structures and complex geometries remains challenging due to unreliable or noisy geometric priors. Existing approaches rely on implicit uncertainty that arises during optimization to filter these priors, which is indirect and inefficient, and masking supervision in high-uncertainty regions further leads to under-constrained optimization. To address these issues, we propose GPU-SDF, a neural implicit framework for indoor surface reconstruction that leverages geometric prior uncertainty and complementary constraints. We introduce a self-supervised module that explicitly estimates prior uncertainty without auxiliary networks. Based on this estimation, we design an uncertainty-guided loss that modulates prior influence rather than discarding it, thereby retaining weak but informative cues. To address regions with high prior uncertainty, GPU-SDF further incorporates two complementary constraints: an edge distance field that strengthens boundary supervision and a multi-view consistency regularization that enforces geometric coherence. Extensive experiments confirm that GPU-SDF improves the reconstruction of fine details and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing frameworks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate proficiency in 2D scenes, extending their perceptual intelligence to 3D point cloud understanding remains a significant challenge. Current approaches focus primarily on aligning 3D features with pre-trained models. However, they typically treat geometric reasoning as an implicit mapping process. These methods bypass intermediate logical steps and consequently suffer from geometric hallucinations. They confidently generate plausible responses that fail to ground in precise structural details. To bridge this gap, we present PointCoT, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for 3D data. We advocate for a \textit{Look, Think, then Answer} paradigm. In this approach, the model is supervised to generate geometry-grounded rationales before predicting final answers. To facilitate this, we construct Point-Reason-Instruct, a large-scale benchmark comprising $\sim$86k instruction-tuning samples with hierarchical CoT annotations. By leveraging a dual-stream multi-modal architecture, our method synergizes semantic appearance with geometric truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) demonstrates significant potential for handling knowledge-intensive tasks. However, conflicts arise between static parametric knowledge in vision language models (VLMs) and dynamically retrieved information due to the static model knowledge from pre-training. The outputs either ignore retrieved contexts or exhibit inconsistent integration with parametric knowledge, posing substantial challenges for KB-VQA. Current knowledge conflict mitigation methods primarily adapted from language-based approaches, focusing on context-level conflicts through engineered prompting strategies or context-aware decoding mechanisms. However, these methods neglect the critical role of visual information in conflicts and suffer from redundant retrieved contexts, which impair accurate conflict identification and effective mitigation. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CC-VQA}: a novel training-free, conflict- and correlation-aware method for KB-VQA. Our method comprises two core components: (1) Vision-Centric Contextual Conflict Reasoning, which performs visual-semantic conflict analysis across internal and external knowledge contexts; and (2) Correlation-Guided Encoding and Decoding, featuring positional encoding compression for low-correlation statements and adaptive decoding using correlation-weighted conflict scoring. Extensive evaluations on E-VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CC-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding absolute accuracy improvements of 3.3\% to 6.4\% compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Occlusion remains a critical challenge in robotic fruit harvesting, as undetected or inaccurately localised fruits often results in substantial crop losses. To mitigate this issue, we propose a harvesting framework using a new amodal segmentation model, GDA-YOLO11, which incorporates architectural improvements and an updated asymmetric mask loss. The proposed model is trained on a modified version of a public citrus dataset and evaluated on both the base dataset and occlusion-sensitive subsets with varying occlusion levels. Within the framework, full fruit masks, including invisible regions, are inferred by GDA-YOLO11, and picking points are subsequently estimated using the Euclidean distance transform. These points are then projected into 3D coordinates for robotic harvesting execution. Experiments were conducted using real citrus fruits in a controlled environment simulating occlusion scenarios. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first practical demonstration of amodal instance segmentation in robotic fruit harvesting. GDA-YOLO11 achieves a precision of 0.844, recall of 0.846, mAP@50 of 0.914, and mAP@50:95 of 0.636, outperforming YOLO11n by 5.1%, 1.3%, and 1.0% in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50:95, respectively. The framework attains harvesting success rates of 92.59%, 85.18%, 48.14%, and 22.22% at zero to high occlusion levels, improving success by 3.5% under medium and high occlusion. These findings demonstrate that GDA-YOLO11 enhances occlusion robust segmentation and streamlines perception-to-action integration, paving the way for more reliable autonomous systems in agriculture.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and temporally coherent videos synthesis. However, current models are predominantly optimized for single-event generation. When handling multi-event prompts, without explicit temporal grounding, such models often produce blended or collapsed scenes that break the intended narrative. To address this limitation, we present SwitchCraft, a training-free framework for multi-event video generation. Our key insight is that uniform prompt injection across time ignores the correspondence between events and frames. To this end, we introduce Event-Aligned Query Steering (EAQS), which steers frame-level attention to align with relevant event prompts. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Balance Strength Solver (ABSS), which adaptively balances steering strength to preserve temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SwitchCraft substantially improves prompt alignment, event clarity, and scene consistency compared with existing baselines, offering a simple yet effective solution for multi-event video generation.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly rely on visual chain-of-thought to perform region-grounded reasoning over images. However, existing approaches ground regions via either textified coordinates-causing modality mismatch and semantic fragmentation or fixed-granularity patches that both limit precise region selection and often require non-trivial architectural changes. In this paper, we propose Numerical Visual Chain-of-Thought (NV-CoT), a framework that enables MLLMs to reason over images using continuous numerical coordinates. NV-CoT expands the MLLM action space from discrete vocabulary tokens to a continuous Euclidean space, allowing models to directly generate bounding-box coordinates as actions with only minimal architectural modification. The framework supports both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. In particular, we replace categorical token policies with a Gaussian (or Laplace) policy over coordinates and introduce stochasticity via reparameterized sampling, making NV-CoT fully compatible with GRPO-style policy optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks against eight representative visual reasoning baselines demonstrate that NV-CoT significantly improves localization precision and final answer accuracy, while also accelerating training convergence, validating the effectiveness of continuous-action visual reasoning in MLLMs. The code is available in https://github.com/kesenzhao/NV-CoT.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient vision, but applying them to RGB visual tracking remains difficult: Existing SNN tracking frameworks either do not fully align with spike-driven computation or do not fully leverage neurons' spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. To address this, we introduce SpikeTrack, a spike-driven framework for energy-efficient RGB object tracking. SpikeTrack employs a novel asymmetric design that uses asymmetric timestep expansion and unidirectional information flow, harnessing spatiotemporal dynamics while cutting computation. To ensure effective unidirectional information transfer between branches, we design a memory-retrieval module inspired by neural inference mechanisms. This module recurrently queries a compact memory initialized by the template to retrieve target cues and sharpen target perception over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpikeTrack achieves the state-of-the-art among SNN-based trackers and remains competitive with advanced ANN trackers. Notably, it surpasses TransT on LaSOT dataset while consuming only 1/26 of its energy. To our knowledge, SpikeTrack is the first spike-driven framework to make RGB tracking both accurate and energy efficient. The code and models are available at https://github.com/faicaiwawa/SpikeTrack.

Abstract: The widespread use of smartphones has made photography ubiquitous, yet a clear gap remains between ordinary users and professional photographers, who can identify aesthetic issues and provide actionable shooting guidance during capture. We define this capability as aesthetic guidance (AG) -- an essential but largely underexplored domain in computational aesthetics. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) primarily offer overly positive feedback, failing to identify issues or provide actionable guidance. Without AG capability, they cannot effectively identify distracting regions or optimize compositional balance, thus also struggling in aesthetic cropping, which aims to refine photo composition through reframing after capture. To address this, we introduce AesGuide, the first large-scale AG dataset and benchmark with 10,748 photos annotated with aesthetic scores, analyses, and guidance. Building upon it, we propose Venus, a two-stage framework that first empowers MLLMs with AG capability through progressively complex aesthetic questions and then activates their aesthetic cropping power via CoT-based rationales. Extensive experiments show that Venus substantially improves AG capability and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in aesthetic cropping, enabling interpretable and interactive aesthetic refinement across both stages of photo creation.

Abstract: Masked Image Generation Models (MIGMs) have achieved great success, yet their efficiency is hampered by the multiple steps of bi-directional attention. In fact, there exists notable redundancy in their computation: when sampling discrete tokens, the rich semantics contained in the continuous features are lost. Some existing works attempt to cache the features to approximate future features. However, they exhibit considerable approximation error under aggressive acceleration rates. We attribute this to their limited expressivity and the failure to account for sampling information. To fill this gap, we propose to learn a lightweight model that incorporates both previous features and sampled tokens, and regresses the average velocity field of feature evolution. The model has moderate complexity that suffices to capture the subtle dynamics while keeping lightweight compared to the original base model. We apply our method, MIGM-Shortcut, to two representative MIGM architectures and tasks. In particular, on the state-of-the-art Lumina-DiMOO, it achieves over 4x acceleration of text-to-image generation while maintaining quality, significantly pushing the Pareto frontier of masked image generation. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/Kaiwen-Zhu/MIGM-Shortcut.

Abstract: It has been suggested that generative image models such as diffusion models can improve performance on clinically relevant tasks by offering deep learning models supplementary training data. However, most conditional diffusion models treat disease stages as independent classes, ignoring the continuous nature of disease progression. This mismatch is problematic in medical imaging because continuous pathological processes are typically only observed through coarse, discrete but ordered labels as in ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy (DR). We propose an ordinal latent diffusion model for generating color fundus images that explicitly incorporates the ordered structure of DR severity into the generation process. Instead of categorical conditioning, we used a scalar disease representation, enabling a smooth transition between adjacent stages. We evaluated our approach using visual realism metrics and classification-based clinical consistency analysis on the EyePACS dataset. Compared to a standard conditional diffusion model, our model reduced the Fréchet inception distance for four of the five DR stages and increased the quadratic weighted $κ$ from 0.79 to 0.87. Furthermore, interpolation experiments showed that the model captured a continuous spectrum of disease progression learned from ordered, coarse class labels.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vision-Language models (VLMs) has raised growing concerns that their black-box reasoning processes could lead to unintended forms of social bias. Current debiasing approaches focus on mitigating surface-level bias signals through post-hoc learning or test-time algorithms, while leaving the internal dynamics of the model largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce an interpretable, model-agnostic bias mitigation framework, DeBiasLens, that localizes social attribute neurons in VLMs through sparse autoencoders (SAEs) applied to multimodal encoders. Building upon the disentanglement ability of SAEs, we train them on facial image or caption datasets without corresponding social attribute labels to uncover neurons highly responsive to specific demographics, including those that are underrepresented. By selectively deactivating the social neurons most strongly tied to bias for each group, we effectively mitigate socially biased behaviors of VLMs without degrading their semantic knowledge. Our research lays the groundwork for future auditing tools, prioritizing social fairness in emerging real-world AI systems.

Abstract: 3D super-resolution (3DSR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) 3D scenes from low-resolution (LR) multi-view images. Existing methods rely on dense LR inputs and per-scene optimization, which restricts the high-frequency priors for constructing HR 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to those inherited from pretrained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models. This severely limits reconstruction fidelity, cross-scene generalization, and real-time usability. We propose to reformulate 3DSR as a direct feed-forward mapping from sparse LR views to HR 3DGS representations, enabling the model to autonomously learn 3D-specific high-frequency geometry and appearance from large-scale, multi-scene data. This fundamentally changes how 3DSR acquires high-frequency knowledge and enables robust generalization to unseen scenes. Specifically, we introduce SR3R, a feed-forward framework that directly predicts HR 3DGS representations from sparse LR views via the learned mapping network. To further enhance reconstruction fidelity, we introduce Gaussian offset learning and feature refinement, which stabilize reconstruction and sharpen high-frequency details. SR3R is plug-and-play and can be paired with any feed-forward 3DGS reconstruction backbone: the backbone provides an LR 3DGS scaffold, and SR3R upscales it to an HR 3DGS. Extensive experiments across three 3D benchmarks demonstrate that SR3R surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DSR methods and achieves strong zero-shot generalization, even outperforming SOTA per-scene optimization methods on unseen scenes.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify abnormal events in videos. Traditional VAD methods generally suffer from the high costs of labeled data and full training, thus some recent works have explored leveraging frozen multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in a tuning-free manner to perform VAD. However, their performance is limited as they directly inherit pre-training biases and cannot adapt internal representations to specific video contexts, leading to difficulties in handling subtle or ambiguous anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel intervention framework, termed SteerVAD, which advances MLLM-based VAD by shifting from passively reading to actively steering and rectifying internal representations. Our approach first leverages the gradient-free representational separability analysis (RSA) to identify top attention heads as latent anomaly experts (LAEs) which are most discriminative for VAD. Then a hierarchical meta-controller (HMC) generates dynamic rectification signals by jointly conditioning on global context and these LAE outputs. The signals execute targeted, anisotropic scaling directly upon the LAE representation manifolds, amplifying anomaly-relevant dimensions while suppressing inherent biases. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free approaches requiring only 1% of training data, establishing it as a powerful new direction for video anomaly detection. The code will be released upon the publication.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning tasks, yet ensuring their safety remains a critical challenge. Recent input-side defenses detect unsafe images with CLIP and prepend safety prefixes to prompts, but they still suffer from inaccurate detection in complex scenes and unstable safety signals during decoding. To address these issues, we propose GuardAlign, a training-free defense framework that integrates two strategies. First, OT-enhanced safety detection leverages optimal transport to measure distribution distances between image patches and unsafe semantics, enabling accurate identification of malicious regions without additional computational cost. Second, cross-modal attentive calibration strengthens the influence of safety prefixes by adaptively reallocating attention across layers, ensuring that safety signals remain consistently activated throughout generation. Extensive evaluations on six representative MLLMs demonstrate that GuardAlign reduces unsafe response rates by up to 39% on SPA-VL, while preserving utility, achieving an improvement on VQAv2 from 78.51% to 79.21%.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to hallucination, where generated content deviates from visual evidence. Existing mitigation strategies either require costly supervision during training or introduce additional latency at inference time. Recent vision enhancement methods attempt to address this issue by reinforcing visual tokens during decoding, but they typically inject all tokens indiscriminately, which causes interference from background regions and distracts the model from critical cues. To overcome this challenge, we propose Adaptive Visual Reinforcement (AIR), a training-free framework for MLLMs. AIR consists of two components. Prototype-based token reduction condenses the large pool of visual tokens into a compact subset to suppress redundancy. OT-guided patch reinforcement quantifies the alignment between hidden states and patch embeddings to selectively integrate the most consistent patches into feed-forward layers. As a result, AIR enhances the model's reliance on salient visual information and effectively mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments across representative MLLMs demonstrate that AIR substantially reduces hallucination while preserving general capabilities, establishing it as an effective solution for building reliable MLLMs.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from monocular images and videos is a fundamental problem with applications in virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. Despite significant progress in human body recovery, accurately reconstructing garment geometry, particularly for loose-fitting clothing, remains an open challenge. We propose a unified framework for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from both single images and video sequences. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn expressive garment shape priors in 2D UV space. Leveraging these priors, we introduce a mapping model that establishes correspondences between image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling accurate and detailed garment reconstruction from single images. We further extend this formulation to dynamic reconstruction by introducing a spatio-temporal diffusion scheme with test-time guidance to enforce long-range temporal consistency. We also develop analytic projection-based constraints that preserve image-aligned geometry in visible regions while enforcing coherent completion in occluded areas over time. Although trained exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes well to real-world imagery and consistently outperforms existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments preserve fine geometric detail while exhibiting realistic dynamic motion, supporting downstream applications such as texture editing, garment retargeting, and animation.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective technique for alleviating the substantial computational and memory overheads of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by compressing both weights and activations without retraining the full model. Existing PTQ methods primarily rely on static identification and global compensation of sensitive or outlier channels, yet they often overlook the distributional differences of these important channels across inputs, leading to unsatisfactory quantization. In this work, we observe that the distributions and occurrence frequencies of important channels vary significantly both across modalities and among tokens, even within the same modality. Accordingly, we propose \textbf{Quant Experts (QE)}, a token-aware adaptive error compensation with mixture-of-experts for VLMs quantization. QE divides the important channels into token-independent and token-dependent groups. For the former, a shared expert is designed for most tokens to compensate for global quantization error using a low-rank adapter. For the latter, routed experts including multiple routed low-rank adapters are elaborated to compensate for local quantization error related to specific tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QE consistently enhances task accuracy across various quantization settings and model scales, ranging from 2B to 70B parameters, while maintaining performance comparable to full-precision models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural surface reconstruction have significantly enhanced 3D reconstruction. However, current real world datasets mainly focus on benchmarking multiview stereo (MVS) based on RGB inputs. Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) and multiview shape from polarization (MVSfP), though indispensable on high-fidelity surface reconstruction and sparse inputs, have not been quantitatively assessed together with MVS. To determine the working range of different MVX (MVS, MVSfP, and MVPS) techniques, we propose EvalMVX, a real-world dataset containing $25$ objects, each captured with a polarized camera under $20$ varying views and $17$ light conditions including OLAT and natural illumination, leading to $8,500$ images. Each object includes aligned ground-truth 3D mesh, facilitating quantitative benchmarking of MVX methods simultaneously. Based on our EvalMVX, we evaluate $13$ MVX methods published in recent years, record the best-performing methods, and identify open problems under diverse geometric details and reflectance types. We hope EvalMVX and the benchmarking results can inspire future research on multiview 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Learning directly from boundary representations (B-reps) has significantly advanced 3D CAD analysis. However, state-of-the-art B-rep learning methods rely on absolute coordinates and normals to encode global context, making them highly sensitive to rotations. Our experiments reveal that models achieving over 95% accuracy on aligned benchmarks can collapse to as low as 10% under arbitrary $\mathbf{SO}(3)$ rotations. To address this, we introduce FoV-Net, the first B-rep learning framework that captures both local surface geometry and global structural context in a rotation-invariant manner. Each face is represented by a Local Reference Frame (LRF) UV-grid that encodes its local surface geometry, and by Field-of-View (FoV) grids that capture the surrounding 3D context by casting rays and recording intersections with neighboring faces. Lightweight CNNs extract per-face features, which are propagated over the B-rep graph using a graph attention network. FoV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on B-rep classification and segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating robustness to arbitrary rotations while also requiring less training data to achieve strong results.

Abstract: Simulation is essential to the development and evaluation of autonomous robots such as self-driving vehicles. Neural reconstruction is emerging as a promising solution as it enables simulating a wide variety of scenarios from real-world data alone in an automated and scalable way. However, while methods such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting can produce visually compelling results, they often exhibit artifacts particularly when rendering novel views, and fail to realistically integrate inserted dynamic objects, especially when they were captured from different scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffusionHarmonizer, an online generative enhancement framework that transforms renderings from such imperfect scenes into temporally consistent outputs while improving their realism. At its core is a single-step temporally-conditioned enhancer that is converted from a pretrained multi-step image diffusion model, capable of running in online simulators on a single GPU. The key to training it effectively is a custom data curation pipeline that constructs synthetic-real pairs emphasizing appearance harmonization, artifact correction, and lighting realism. The result is a scalable system that significantly elevates simulation fidelity in both research and production environments.

Abstract: In 3D point cloud object tracking, the motion-centric methods have emerged as a promising avenue due to its superior performance in modeling inter-frame motion. However, existing two-stage motion-based approaches suffer from fundamental limitations: (1) error accumulation due to decoupled optimization caused by explicit foreground segmentation prior to motion estimation, and (2) computational bottlenecks from sequential processing. To address these challenges, we propose FocusTrack, a novel one-stage paradigms tracking framework that unifies motion-semantics co-modeling through two core innovations: Inter-frame Motion Modeling (IMM) and Focus-and-Suppress Attention. The IMM module employs a temp-oral-difference siamese encoder to capture global motion patterns between adjacent frames. The Focus-and-Suppress attention that enhance the foreground semantics via motion-salient feature gating and suppress the background noise based on the temporal-aware motion context from IMM without explicit segmentation. Based on above two designs, FocusTrack enables end-to-end training with compact one-stage pipeline. Extensive experiments on prominent 3D tracking benchmarks, such as KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo, demonstrate that the FocusTrack achieves new SOTA performance while running at a high speed with 105 FPS.

Abstract: Recent significant advances in 3D scene representation have been driven by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has enabled real-time rendering with photorealistic quality. 3DGS often requires a large number of primitives to achieve high fidelity, leading to redundant representations and high resource consumption, thereby limiting its scalability for complex or large-scale scenes. Consequently, effective pruning strategies and more expressive primitives that can reduce redundancy while preserving visual quality are crucial for practical deployment. We propose an efficient, integrated reconstruction-aware pruning strategy that adaptively determines pruning timing and refining intervals based on reconstruction quality, thus reducing model size while enhancing rendering quality. Moreover, we introduce a 3D Difference-of-Gaussians primitive that jointly models both positive and negative densities in a single primitive, improving the expressiveness of Gaussians under compact configurations. Our method significantly improves model compactness, achieving up to 90\% reduction in Gaussian-count while delivering visual quality that is similar to, or in some cases better than, that produced by state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recognizing surgical phases and steps from video is a fundamental problem in computer-assisted interventions. Recent approaches increasingly rely on large-scale pre-training on thousands of labeled surgical videos, followed by zero-shot transfer to specific procedures. While effective, this strategy incurs substantial computational and data collection costs. In this work, we question whether such heavy pre-training is truly necessary. We propose Text-Augmented Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (TASOT), an unsupervised method for surgical phase and step recognition that extends Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (ASOT) by incorporating textual information generated directly from the videos. TASOT formulates temporal action segmentation as a multimodal optimal transport problem, where the matching cost is defined as a weighted combination of visual and text-based costs. The visual term captures frame-level appearance similarity, while the text term provides complementary semantic cues, and both are jointly regularized through a temporally consistent unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulation. This design enables effective alignment between video frames and surgical actions without surgical-specific pretraining or external web-scale supervision. We evaluate TASOT on multiple benchmark surgical datasets and observe consistent and substantial improvements over existing zero-shot methods, including StrasBypass70 (+23.7), BernBypass70 (+4.5), Cholec80 (+16.5), and AutoLaparo (+19.6). These results demonstrate that fine-grained surgical understanding can be achieved by exploiting information already present in standard visual and textual representations, without resorting to increasingly complex pre-training pipelines. The code will be available at https://github.com/omar8ahmed9/TASOT.

Abstract: Decoupled dataset distillation (DD) compresses large corpora into a few synthetic images by matching a frozen teacher's statistics. However, current residual-matching pipelines rely on static real patches, creating a fit-complexity gap and a pull-to-anchor effect that reduce intra-class diversity and hurt generalization. To address these issues, we introduce RETA -- a Retrieval and Topology Alignment framework for decoupled DD. First, Dynamic Retrieval Connection (DRC) selects a real patch from a prebuilt pool by minimizing a fit-complexity score in teacher feature space; the chosen patch is injected via a residual connection to tighten feature fit while controlling injected complexity. Second, Persistent Topology Alignment (PTA) regularizes synthesis with persistent homology: we build a mutual k-NN feature graph, compute persistence images of components and loops, and penalize topology discrepancies between real and synthetic sets, mitigating pull-to-anchor effect. Across CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and multiple ImageNet subsets, RETA consistently outperforms various baselines under comparable time and memory, especially reaching 64.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-18 at 50 images per class, +3.1% over the best prior.

Abstract: We present a method for generating a full 360° orbit video around a person from a single input image. Existing methods typically adapt image-based diffusion models for multi-view synthesis, but yield inconsistent results across views and with the original identity. In contrast, recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their ability in generating photorealistic results that align well with the given prompts. Inspired by these results, we propose HumanOrbit, a video diffusion model for multi-view human image generation. Our approach enables the model to synthesize continuous camera rotations around the subject, producing geometrically consistent novel views while preserving the appearance and identity of the person. Using the generated multi-view frames, we further propose a reconstruction pipeline that recovers a textured mesh of the subject. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of HumanOrbit for multi-view image generation and that the reconstructed 3D models exhibit superior completeness and fidelity compared to those from state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Vision transformers have recently made a breakthrough in computer vision showing excellent performance in terms of precision for numerous applications. However, their computational cost is very high compared to alternative approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for image classification called RAViT based on a multi-branch network that operates on several copies of the same image with different resolutions to reduce the computational cost while preserving the overall accuracy. Furthermore, our framework includes an early exit mechanism that makes our model adaptive and allows to choose the appropriate trade-off between accuracy and computational cost at run-time. For example in a two-branch architecture, the original image is first resized to reduce its resolution, then a prediction is performed on it using a first transformer and the resulting prediction is reused together with the original-size image to perform a final prediction on a second transformer with less computation than a classical Vision transformer architecture. The early-exit process allows the model to make a final prediction at intermediate branches, saving even more computation. We evaluated our approach on CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet. We obtained an equivalent accuracy to the classical Vision transformer model with only around 70% of FLOPs.

Abstract: High-dimensional images, or images with a high-dimensional attribute vector per pixel, are commonly explored with coordinated views of a low-dimensional embedding of the attribute space and a conventional image representation. Nowadays, such images can easily contain several million pixels. For such large datasets, hierarchical embedding techniques are better suited to represent the high-dimensional attribute space than flat dimensionality reduction methods. However, available hierarchical dimensionality reduction methods construct the hierarchy purely based on the attribute information and ignore the spatial layout of pixels in the images. This impedes the exploration of regions of interest in the image space, since there is no congruence between a region of interest in image space and the associated attribute abstractions in the hierarchy. In this paper, we present a superpixel hierarchy for high-dimensional images that takes the high-dimensional attribute manifold into account during construction. Through this, our method enables consistent exploration of high-dimensional images in both image and attribute space. We show the effectiveness of this new image-guided hierarchy in the context of embedding exploration by comparing it with classical hierarchical embedding-based image exploration in two use cases.

Abstract: Reconstructing photorealistic and animatable 4D head avatars from a single portrait image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. While diffusion models have enabled remarkable progress in image and video generation for avatar reconstruction, existing methods primarily rely on 2D priors and struggle to achieve consistent 3D geometry. We propose a novel framework that leverages geometry-aware diffusion to learn strong geometry priors for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction. Our approach jointly synthesizes portrait images and corresponding surface normals, while a pose-free expression encoder captures implicit expression representations. Both synthesized images and expression latents are incorporated into 3D Gaussian-based avatars, enabling photorealistic rendering with accurate geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, expression fidelity, and cross-identity generalization, while supporting real-time rendering.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision encoders like DINOv2 have demonstrated exceptional performance on unimodal tasks. However, we observe that their feature representations are poorly aligned across different modalities. For instance, the feature embedding for an RGB image and its corresponding depth map of the same scene exhibit a cosine similarity that is nearly identical to that of two random, unrelated images. To address this, we propose the Omnivorous Vision Encoder, a novel framework that learns a modality-agnostic feature space. We train the encoder with a dual objective: first, to maximize the feature alignment between different modalities of the same scene; and second, a distillation objective that anchors the learned representations to the output of a fully frozen teacher such as DINOv2. The resulting student encoder becomes "omnivorous" by producing a consistent, powerful embedding for a given scene, regardless of the input modality (RGB, Depth, Segmentation, etc.). This approach enables robust cross-modal understanding while retaining the discriminative semantics of the original foundation model.

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning-based medical image classifiers, the safety and reliability of these systems remain major concerns in practical settings. Existing auditing approaches mainly rely on unimodal features or metadata-based subgroup analyses, which are limited in interpretability and often fail to capture hidden systematic failures. To address these limitations, we introduce the first automated auditing framework that extends slice discovery methods to multimodal representations specifically for medical applications. Comprehensive experiments were conducted under common failure scenarios using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset, demonstrating the framework's strong capability in both failure discovery and explanation generation. Our results also show that multimodal information generally allows more comprehensive and effective auditing of classifiers, while unimodal variants beyond image-only inputs exhibit strong potential in scenarios where resources are constrained.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art video generation quality, but their inference remains expensive due to the large number of sequential denoising steps. This has motivated a growing line of research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching (SenCache), a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets.

Abstract: Modern microscopy routinely produces gigapixel images that contain structures across multiple spatial scales, from fine cellular morphology to broader tissue organization. Many analysis tasks require combining these scales, yet most vision models operate at a single resolution or derive multi-scale features from one view, limiting their ability to exploit the inherently multi-resolution nature of microscopy data. We introduce MuViT, a transformer architecture built to fuse true multi-resolution observations from the same underlying image. MuViT embeds all patches into a shared world-coordinate system and extends rotary positional embeddings to these coordinates, enabling attention to integrate wide-field context with high-resolution detail within a single encoder. Across synthetic benchmarks, kidney histopathology, and high-resolution mouse-brain microscopy, MuViT delivers consistent improvements over strong ViT and CNN baselines. Multi-resolution MAE pretraining further produces scale-consistent representations that enhance downstream tasks. These results demonstrate that explicit world-coordinate modelling provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for leveraging multi-resolution information in large-scale microscopy analysis.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image generation has greatly advanced visual fidelity and creativity, but it has also imposed higher demands on prompt complexity-particularly in encoding intricate spatial relationships. In such cases, achieving satisfactory results often requires multiple sampling attempts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method that strengthens the spatial understanding of current image generation models. We first construct the SpatialReward-Dataset with over 80k preference pairs. Building on this dataset, we build SpatialScore, a reward model designed to evaluate the accuracy of spatial relationships in text-to-image generation, achieving performance that even surpasses leading proprietary models on spatial evaluation. We further demonstrate that this reward model effectively enables online reinforcement learning for the complex spatial generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) achieves impressive perceptual quality but suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent distillation approaches leveraging large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) priors have enabled one-step generation, they are typically hindered by prohibitive parameter counts and the inherent capability bounds imposed by teacher models. As a lightweight alternative, Consistency Models offer efficient inference but struggle with two critical limitations: the accumulation of consistency drift inherent to transitive training, and a phenomenon we term "Geometric Decoupling" - where the generative trajectory achieves pixel-wise alignment yet fails to preserve structural coherence. To address these challenges, we propose GTASR (Geometric Trajectory Alignment Super-Resolution), a simple yet effective consistency training paradigm for Real-ISR. Specifically, we introduce a Trajectory Alignment (TA) strategy to rectify the tangent vector field via full-path projection, and a Dual-Reference Structural Rectification (DRSR) mechanism to enforce strict structural constraints. Extensive experiments verify that GTASR delivers superior performance over representative baselines while maintaining minimal latency. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/Blazedengcy/GTASR.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to recognize familiar parts in novel contexts, is a defining property of intelligent systems. Although modern models are trained on massive datasets, they still cover only a tiny fraction of the combinatorial space of possible inputs, raising the question of what structure representations must have to support generalization to unseen combinations. We formalize three desiderata for compositional generalization under standard training (divisibility, transferability, stability) and show they impose necessary geometric constraints: representations must decompose linearly into per-concept components, and these components must be orthogonal across concepts. This provides theoretical grounding for the Linear Representation Hypothesis: the linear structure widely observed in neural representations is a necessary consequence of compositional generalization. We further derive dimension bounds linking the number of composable concepts to the embedding geometry. Empirically, we evaluate these predictions across modern vision models (CLIP, SigLIP, DINO) and find that representations exhibit partial linear factorization with low-rank, near-orthogonal per-concept factors, and that the degree of this structure correlates with compositional generalization on unseen combinations. As models continue to scale, these conditions predict the representational geometry they may converge to. Code is available at https://github.com/oshapio/necessary-compositionality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Humans perceive actions through key transitions that structure actions across multiple abstraction levels, whereas machines, relying on visual features, tend to over-segment. This highlights the difficulty of enabling hierarchical reasoning in video understanding. Interestingly, we observe that lower-level visual and high-level action latent variables evolve at different rates, with low-level visual variables changing rapidly, while high-level action variables evolve more slowly, making them easier to identify. Building on this insight, we propose the Hierarchical Action Learning (\textbf{HAL}) model for weakly-supervised action segmentation. Our approach introduces a hierarchical causal data generation process, where high-level latent action governs the dynamics of low-level visual features. To model these varying timescales effectively, we introduce deterministic processes to align these latent variables over time. The \textbf{HAL} model employs a hierarchical pyramid transformer to capture both visual features and latent variables, and a sparse transition constraint is applied to enforce the slower dynamics of high-level action variables. This mechanism enhances the identification of these latent variables over time. Under mild assumptions, we prove that these latent action variables are strictly identifiable. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that the \textbf{HAL} model significantly outperforms existing methods for weakly-supervised action segmentation, confirming its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Scaling video generation from seconds to minutes faces a critical bottleneck: while short-video data is abundant and high-fidelity, coherent long-form data is scarce and limited to narrow domains. To address this, we propose a training paradigm where Mode Seeking meets Mean Seeking, decoupling local fidelity from long-term coherence based on a unified representation via a Decoupled Diffusion Transformer. Our approach utilizes a global Flow Matching head trained via supervised learning on long videos to capture narrative structure, while simultaneously employing a local Distribution Matching head that aligns sliding windows to a frozen short-video teacher via a mode-seeking reverse-KL divergence. This strategy enables the synthesis of minute-scale videos that learns long-range coherence and motions from limited long videos via supervised flow matching, while inheriting local realism by aligning every sliding-window segment of the student to a frozen short-video teacher, resulting in a few-step fast long video generator. Evaluations show that our method effectively closes the fidelity-horizon gap by jointly improving local sharpness, motion and long-range consistency.

Abstract: Dense 4D reconstruction from unposed images remains a critical challenge, with current methods relying on slow test-time optimization or fragmented, task-specific feedforward models. We introduce UFO-4D, a unified feedforward framework to reconstruct a dense, explicit 4D representation from just a pair of unposed images. UFO-4D directly estimates dynamic 3D Gaussian Splats, enabling the joint and consistent estimation of 3D geometry, 3D motion, and camera pose in a feedforward manner. Our core insight is that differentiably rendering multiple signals from a single Dynamic 3D Gaussian representation offers major training advantages. This approach enables a self-supervised image synthesis loss while tightly coupling appearance, depth, and motion. Since all modalities share the same geometric primitives, supervising one inherently regularizes and improves the others. This synergy overcomes data scarcity, allowing UFO-4D to outperform prior work by up to 3 times in joint geometry, motion, and camera pose estimation. Our representation also enables high-fidelity 4D interpolation across novel views and time. Please visit our project page for visual results: https://ufo-4d.github.io/

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Long-document topic segmentation plays an important role in information retrieval and document understanding, yet existing methods still show clear shortcomings in ultra-long text settings. Traditional discriminative models are constrained by fixed windows and cannot model document-level semantics; generative large language models can output paragraph boundaries, but inference is expensive and long inputs are difficult to support. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative segmentation model based on Qwen3-0.6B. On top of the backbone network, we add a cross-window context fusion layer and a boundary classification head, and combine them with an overlapping sliding-window strategy. Our model supports single-pass inputs of up to 13k tokens and can be extended to ultra-long documents for paragraph boundary detection. To further enhance downstream retrieval efficiency, we derive a vector fusion method with scalar correction, which compresses the representation of ultra-long segments into a single vector without semantic loss. Experiments on the Wikipedia long-document topic segmentation dataset WIKI-727K show that, compared with three generative models based on Qwen2-0.5B released by Jina, our method achieves a better macro-averaged F1 and delivers two orders of magnitude faster inference, substantially improving the practicality and scalability of long-document processing.

Abstract: The rising demand for inclusive speech technologies amplifies the need for multilingual datasets for Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. However, limited awareness of existing task-specific resources in low-resource languages hinders research. This challenge is especially acute in linguistically diverse countries, such as India. Cross-task profiling of existing Indian speech datasets can alleviate the data scarcity challenge. This involves investigating the utility of datasets across multiple downstream tasks rather than focusing on a single task. Prior surveys typically catalogue datasets for a single task, leaving comprehensive cross-task profiling as an open opportunity. Therefore, we propose Task-Lens, a cross-task survey that assesses the readiness of 50 Indian speech datasets spanning 26 languages for nine downstream speech tasks. First, we analyze which datasets contain metadata and properties suitable for specific tasks. Next, we propose task-aligned enhancements to unlock datasets to their full downstream potential. Finally, we identify tasks and Indian languages that are critically underserved by current resources. Our findings reveal that many Indian speech datasets contain untapped metadata that can support multiple downstream tasks. By uncovering cross-task linkages and gaps, Task-Lens enables researchers to explore the broader applicability of existing datasets and to prioritize dataset creation for underserved tasks and languages.

Abstract: Training large language models to reason with search engines via reinforcement learning is hindered by a fundamental credit assignment problem: existing methods such as Search-R1 provide only a sparse outcome reward after an entire multi-step trajectory, making it infeasible to attribute success or failure to individual reasoning and retrieval decisions. Process-reward methods like StepSearch alleviate this by introducing step-level supervision, but rely on heuristic rewards such as TF-IDF overlap with gold documents, and still sample k complete trajectories per example, retaining high gradient variance. We propose SLATE, a framework built on two complementary ideas: (1) truncated step-level sampling, which generates k trajectories that share a common prefix and differ only at the next step, and (2) dense LLM-as-judge rewards, which replace heuristic scoring with a capable LLM evaluator that assesses the quality of each reasoning step, search query, and answer, providing richer and more reliable supervision. We theoretically prove that under the same dense reward structure, truncated sampling reduces the variance of advantage estimates by up to a factor of T compared to full-trajectory sampling for T-step trajectories, yielding lower-variance, better-targeted policy gradients. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks confirm that SLATE consistently outperforms both sparse-reward and process-reward baselines, with the largest gains on harder multi-hop tasks and smaller models.

Abstract: Scientific research relies on accurate citation for attribution and integrity, yet large language models (LLMs) introduce a new risk: fabricated references that appear plausible but correspond to no real publications. Such hallucinated citations have already been observed in submissions and accepted papers at major machine learning venues, exposing vulnerabilities in peer review. Meanwhile, rapidly growing reference lists make manual verification impractical, and existing automated tools remain fragile to noisy and heterogeneous citation formats and lack standardized evaluation. We present the first comprehensive benchmark and detection framework for hallucinated citations in scientific writing. Our multi-agent verification pipeline decomposes citation checking into claim extraction, evidence retrieval, passage matching, reasoning, and calibrated judgment to assess whether a cited source truly supports its claim. We construct a large-scale human-validated dataset across domains and define unified metrics for citation faithfulness and evidence alignment. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial citation errors and show that our framework significantly outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and interpretability. This work provides the first scalable infrastructure for auditing citations in the LLM era and practical tools to improve the trustworthiness of scientific references.

Abstract: Though patients are increasingly granted digital access to their electronic health records (EHRs), existing interfaces may not support precise, trustworthy answers to patient-specific questions. Large language models (LLM) show promise in clinical question answering (QA), but retrieval-based approaches are computationally inefficient, prone to hallucination, and difficult to deploy over real-life EHRs. In this work, we introduce FHIRPath-QA, the first open dataset and benchmark for patient-specific QA that includes open-standard FHIRPath queries over real-world clinical data. We propose a text-to-FHIRPath QA paradigm that shifts reasoning from free-text generation to FHIRPath query synthesis, significantly reducing LLM usage. Built on MIMIC-IV on FHIR Demo, the dataset pairs over 14k natural language questions in patient and clinician phrasing with validated FHIRPath queries and answers. Further, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to deal with ambiguity in patient language and perform poorly in FHIRPath query synthesis. However, they benefit strongly from supervised fine-tuning. Our results highlight that text-to-FHIRPath synthesis has the potential to serve as a practical foundation for safe, efficient, and interoperable consumer health applications, and our dataset and benchmark serve as a starting point for future research on the topic.

Abstract: Understanding and extracting structured insights from unstructured documents remains a foundational challenge in industrial NLP. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot extraction, traditional pipelines often fail to handle multi-document packets, complex reasoning, and strict compliance requirements. We present IDP (Intelligent Document Processing) Accelerator, a framework enabling agentic AI for end-to-end document intelligence with four key components: (1) DocSplit, a novel benchmark dataset and multimodal classifier using BIO tagging to segment complex document packets; (2) configurable Extraction Module leveraging multimodal LLMs to transform unstructured content into structured data; (3) Agentic Analytics Module, compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) providing data access through secure, sandboxed code execution; and (4) Rule Validation Module replacing deterministic engines with LLM-driven logic for complex compliance checks. The interactive demonstration enables users to upload document packets, visualize classification results, and explore extracted data through an intuitive web interface. We demonstrate effectiveness across industries, highlighting a production deployment at a leading healthcare provider achieving 98% classification accuracy, 80% reduced processing latency, and 77% lower operational costs over legacy baselines. IDP Accelerator is open-sourced with a live demonstration available to the community.

Abstract: Human reasoning often involves working over limited information to arrive at probabilistic conclusions. In its simplest form, this involves making an inference that is not strictly entailed by a premise, but rather only likely given the premise. While reasoning LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on logical and mathematical tasks, their behavior on such open-ended, non-deterministic inferences remains largely unexplored. We introduce ProbCOPA, a dataset of 210 handcrafted probabilistic inferences in English, each annotated for inference likelihood by 25--30 human participants. We find that human responses are graded and varied, revealing probabilistic judgments of the inferences in our dataset. Comparing these judgments with responses from eight state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, we show that models consistently fail to produce human-like distributions. Finally, analyzing LLM reasoning chains, we find evidence of a common reasoning pattern used to evaluate such inferences. Our findings reveal persistent differences between humans and LLMs, and underscore the need to evaluate reasoning beyond deterministic settings.

Abstract: Sentences like "She will go to France or Spain, or perhaps to Germany or France." appear formally redundant, yet become acceptable in contexts such as "Mary will go to a philosophy program in France or Spain, or a mathematics program in Germany or France." While this phenomenon has typically been analyzed using symbolic formal representations, we aim to provide a complementary account grounded in artificial neural mechanisms. We first present new behavioral evidence from humans and large language models demonstrating the robustness of this apparent non-redundancy across contexts. We then show that, in language models, redundancy avoidance arises from two interacting mechanisms: models learn to bind contextually relevant information to repeated lexical items, and Transformer induction heads selectively attend to these context-licensed representations. We argue that this neural explanation sheds light on the mechanisms underlying context-sensitive semantic interpretation, and that it complements existing symbolic analyses.

Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global public health concern. While social media platforms offer opportunities for early risk detection through online conversation trees, existing approaches face two major limitations: (1) They rely on predefined rules (e.g., quotes or relies) to log conversations that capture only a narrow spectrum of user interactions, and (2) They overlook hidden influences such as user conformity and suicide copycat behavior, which can significantly affect suicidal expression and propagation in online communities. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent Causal Reasoning (MACR) framework that collaboratively employs a Reasoning Agent to scale user interactions and a Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent to mitigate harmful biases arising from hidden influences. The Reasoning Agent integrates cognitive appraisal theory to generate counterfactual user reactions to posts, thereby scaling user interactions. It analyses these reactions through structured dimensions, i.e., cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns, with a dedicated sub-agent responsible for each dimension. The Bias-aware Decision-Making Agent mitigates hidden biases through a front-door adjustment strategy, leveraging the counterfactual user reactions produced by the Reasoning Agent. Through the collaboration of reasoning and bias-aware decision making, the proposed MACR framework not only alleviates hidden biases, but also enriches contextual information of user interactions with counterfactual knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world conversational datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MACR in identifying suicide risk.

Abstract: In the field of educational assessment, automated scoring systems increasingly rely on deep learning and large language models (LLMs). However, these systems face significant risks of bias amplification, where model prediction gaps between student groups become larger than those observed in training data. This issue is especially severe for underrepresented groups such as English Language Learners (ELLs), as models may inherit and further magnify existing disparities in the data. We identify that this issue is closely tied to representation bias: the scarcity of minority (high-scoring ELL) samples makes models trained with empirical risk minimization favor majority (non-ELL) linguistic patterns. Consequently, models tend to under-predict ELL students who even demonstrate comparable domain knowledge but use different linguistic patterns, thereby undermining the fairness of automated scoring outcomes. To mitigate this, we propose BRIDGE, a Bias-Reducing Inter-group Data GEneration framework designed for low-resource assessment settings. Instead of relying on the limited minority samples, BRIDGE synthesizes high-scoring ELL samples by "pasting" construct-relevant (i.e., rubric-aligned knowledge and evidence) content from abundant high-scoring non-ELL samples into authentic ELL linguistic patterns. We further introduce a discriminator model to ensure the quality of synthetic samples. Experiments on California Science Test (CAST) datasets demonstrate that BRIDGE effectively reduces prediction bias for high-scoring ELL students while maintaining overall scoring performance. Notably, our method achieves fairness gains comparable to using additional real human data, offering a cost-effective solution for ensuring equitable scoring in large-scale assessments.

Abstract: The reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), defined as their ability to analyze, infer, and make decisions based on input information, is essential for building intelligent task-oriented dialogue systems. However, existing benchmarks do not sufficiently reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios, which limits their effectiveness in evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning in practical contexts. Many current reasoning datasets are overly simplistic and abstract, often disconnected from realistic task flows, domain constraints, and operational rules, making it difficult to effectively evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning ability. In addition, data contamination from pretraining corpora undermines the reliability of evaluation results, and traditional crowdsourcing methods for dataset construction are labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM-driven framework for synthesizing multi-turn, task-oriented dialogues grounded in realistic reasoning scenarios, leveraging trilevel optimization to enhance dialogue quality. Our method generates dialogues grounded in authentic task scenarios, enriched with real-world information, and exhibiting strong contextual coherence. Corresponding reasoning tasks are carefully designed around these dialogues and iteratively refined to continuously improve the tasks' quality and challenge. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for assessing and advancing the realistic logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results show that our synthetic data-based reasoning tasks introduce non-trivial reasoning challenges and provide meaningful support for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: TRIZ-based contradiction mining is a fundamental task in patent analysis and systematic innovation, as it enables the identification of improving and worsening technical parameters that drive inventive problem solving. However, existing approaches largely rely on rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models, which struggle with semantic ambiguity, domain dependency, and limited generalization when processing complex patent language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong semantic understanding capabilities, yet their direct application to TRIZ parameter extraction remains challenging due to hallucination and insufficient grounding in structured TRIZ knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TRIZ-RAGNER, a retrieval-augmented large language model framework for TRIZ-aware named entity recognition in patent-based contradiction mining. TRIZ-RAGNER reformulates contradiction mining as a semantic-level NER task and integrates dense retrieval over a TRIZ knowledge base, cross-encoder reranking for context refinement, and structured LLM prompting to extract improving and worsening parameters from patent sentences. By injecting domain-specific TRIZ knowledge into the LLM reasoning process, the proposed framework effectively reduces semantic noise and improves extraction consistency. Experiments on the PaTRIZ dataset demonstrate that TRIZ-RAGNER consistently outperforms traditional sequence labeling models and LLM-based baselines. The proposed framework achieves a precision of 85.6%, a recall of 82.9%, and an F1-score of 84.2% in TRIZ contradiction pair identification. Compared with the strongest baseline using prompt-enhanced GPT, TRIZ-RAGNER yields an absolute F1-score improvement of 7.3 percentage points, confirming the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented TRIZ knowledge grounding for robust and accurate patent-based contradiction mining.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on static datasets, which offer limited scalability and fail to capture the evolving reasoning capabilities of recent models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks.

Abstract: This study addresses the issues of semantic entanglement, unclear label structure, and insufficient feature representation in few-shot text classification, and proposes an optimization framework based on structured prompts to enhance semantic understanding and task adaptation under low-resource conditions. The framework first uses a pretrained language model to encode the input text and obtain basic semantic representations. It then introduces structured prompts composed of multi-dimensional semantic factors and integrates them with text features through a learnable combination mechanism, which forms task-related representations with clear boundaries in the latent space. To further strengthen the consistency between text representations and label semantics, the method constructs a structured label embedding matrix and employs a cross-space alignment mechanism to ensure stable matching between textual features and label attributes. In addition, the model applies prompt orthogonality constraints and a joint optimization objective to maintain independence across different semantic factors in the prompts, allowing the structured prompts to provide transparent and controllable guidance for classification decisions. Three types of sensitivity experiments, including learning rate sensitivity, prompt length sensitivity, and data scale sensitivity, are designed to evaluate the stability and robustness of the framework under different conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed structured prompt optimization framework effectively alleviates semantic conflicts and label ambiguity in few-shot text classification. It significantly improves performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, and demonstrates strong cross-task applicability.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have shown promising performance across various reasoning tasks, establishing themselves as an alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). Unlike autoregressive LLMs that generate one token per step based on all previous tokens, dLLMs theoretically enable parallel generation of multiple tokens at each decoding step. However, recent dLLMs still favor one-token-per-step generation in practice, as directly decoding multiple masked tokens often leads to degraded generation quality and stability. This reveals a substantial gap between the theoretical parallelism and practical performance of dLLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce an adaptive parallel decoding approach, namely DiCo, which features a three-phase divide-and-conquer paradigm to unleash the inherent parallelism of dLLMs. During the Divide phase, DiCo first explores the input masked sequence and identifies masked tokens as seed tokens, which are then expanded to construct a set of local clusters. During the Conquer phase, DiCo performs parallel decoding across different local clusters constructed in the Divide phase. The divide-and-conquer process repeatedly alternates between the Divide and Conquer phases until convergence. During the Finalize phase, DiCo decodes the remaining few masked tokens using an effective fine-grained compound decoding scheme to finalize the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiCo can achieve significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive generation quality.

Abstract: We present GLUScope, an open-source tool for analyzing neurons in Transformer-based language models, intended for interpretability researchers. We focus on more recent models than previous tools do; specifically we consider gated activation functions such as SwiGLU. This introduces a new challenge: understanding positive activations is not enough. Instead, both the gate and the in activation of a neuron can be positive or negative, leading to four different possible sign combinations that in some cases have quite different functionalities. Accordingly, for any neuron, our tool shows text examples for each of the four sign combinations, and indicates how often each combination occurs. We describe examples of how our tool can lead to novel insights. A demo is available at https: //sjgerstner.github.io/gluscope.

Abstract: Chinese text correction has traditionally focused on spelling and grammar, while factual error correction is usually treated separately. However, in paragraph-level Chinese professional writing, linguistic (word/grammar/punctuation) and factual errors frequently co-occur and interact, making unified correction both necessary and challenging. This paper introduces CLFEC (Chinese Linguistic & Factual Error Correction), a new task for joint linguistic and factual correction. We construct a mixed, multi-domain Chinese professional writing dataset spanning current affairs, finance, law, and medicine. We then conduct a systematic study of LLM-based correction paradigms, from prompting to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agentic workflows. The analysis reveals practical challenges, including limited generalization of specialized correction models, the need for evidence grounding for factual repair, the difficulty of mixed-error paragraphs, and over-correction on clean inputs. Results further show that handling linguistic and factual Error within the same context outperform decoupled processes, and that agentic workflows can be effective with suitable backbone models. Overall, our dataset and empirical findings provide guidance for building reliable, fully automatic proofreading systems in industrial settings.

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) have an astonishing ability to recover meaning from severely degraded English texts. Texts in which content words have been randomly substituted by nonsense strings, e.g., "At the ghybe of the swuint, we are haiveed to Wourge Phrear-gwurr, who sproles into an ghitch flount with his crurp", can be translated to conventional English that is, in many cases, close to the original text, e.g., "At the start of the story, we meet a man, Chow, who moves into an apartment building with his wife." These results show that structural cues (e.g., morphosyntax, closed-class words) constrain lexical meaning to a much larger degree than imagined. Although the abilities of LLMs to make sense of "Jabberwockified" English are clearly superhuman, they are highly relevant to understanding linguistic structure and suggest that efficient language processing either in biological or artificial systems likely benefits from very tight integration between syntax, lexical semantics, and general world knowledge.

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) across many languages. However, Nepali, a low-resource language written in Devanagari script, remains relatively underexplored. This study benchmarks multilingual, Indic, Hindi, and Nepali BERT variants to evaluate their effectiveness in Nepali topic classification. Ten pre-trained models, including mBERT, XLM-R, MuRIL, DevBERT, HindiBERT, IndicBERT, and NepBERTa, were fine-tuned and tested on the balanced Nepali dataset containing 25,006 sentences across five conceptual domains and the performance was evaluated using accuracy, weighted precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC metrics. The results reveal that Indic models, particularly MuRIL-large, achieved the highest F1-score of 90.60%, outperforming multilingual and monolingual models. NepBERTa also performed competitively with an F1-score of 88.26%. Overall, these findings establish a robust baseline for future document-level classification and broader Nepali NLP applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dataset of enriched geographic coordinates retrieved from Diderot and d'Alembert's eighteenth-century Encyclopedie. Automatically recovering geographic coordinates from historical texts is a complex task, as they are expressed in a variety of ways and with varying levels of precision. To improve retrieval of coordinates from similar digitized early modern texts, we have created a gold standard dataset, trained models, published the resulting inferred and normalized coordinate data, and experimented applying these models to new texts. From 74,000 total articles in each of the digitized versions of the Encyclopedie from ARTFL and ENCCRE, we examined 15,278 geographical entries, manually identifying 4,798 containing coordinates, and 10,480 with descriptive but non-numerical references. Leveraging our gold standard annotations, we trained transformer-based models to retrieve and normalize coordinates. The pipeline presented here combines a classifier to identify coordinate-bearing entries and a second model for retrieval, tested across encoder-decoder and decoder architectures. Cross-validation yielded an 86% EM score. On an out-of-domain eighteenth-century Trevoux dictionary (also in French), our fine-tuned model had a 61% EM score, while for the nineteenth-century, 7th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica in English, the EM was 77%. These findings highlight the gold standard dataset's usefulness as training data, and our two-step method's cross-lingual, cross-domain generalizability.

Abstract: Memory systems address the challenge of context loss in Large Language Model during prolonged interactions. However, compared to human cognition, the efficacy of these systems in processing emotion-related information remains inconclusive. To address this gap, we propose an emotion-enhanced memory evaluation benchmark to assess the performance of mainstream and state-of-the-art memory systems in handling affective information. We developed the \textbf{H}uman-\textbf{L}ike \textbf{M}emory \textbf{E}motion (\textbf{HLME}) dataset, which evaluates memory systems across three dimensions: emotional information extraction, emotional memory updating, and emotional memory question answering. Experimental results indicate that none of the evaluated systems achieve robust performance across all three tasks. Our findings provide an objective perspective on the current deficiencies of memory systems in processing emotional memories and suggest a new trajectory for future research and system optimization.

Abstract: Spanish is the official language of twenty-one countries and is spoken by over 441 million people. Naturally, there are many variations in how Spanish is spoken across these countries. Media platforms such as YouTube rely on automatic speech recognition systems to make their content accessible to different groups of users. However, YouTube offers only one option for automatically generating captions in Spanish. This raises the question: could this captioning system be biased against certain Spanish dialects? This study examines the potential biases in YouTube's automatic captioning system by analyzing its performance across various Spanish dialects. By comparing the quality of captions for female and male speakers from different regions, we identify systematic disparities which can be attributed to specific dialects. Our study provides further evidence that algorithmic technologies deployed on digital platforms need to be calibrated to the diverse needs and experiences of their user populations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have fueled a compelling narrative that reasoning universally improves performance across language tasks. We test this claim through a comprehensive evaluation of 504 configurations across seven model families--including adaptive, conditional, and reinforcement learning-based reasoning architectures--on sentiment analysis datasets of varying granularity (binary, five-class, and 27-class emotion). Our findings reveal that reasoning effectiveness is strongly task-dependent, challenging prevailing assumptions: (1) Reasoning shows task-complexity dependence--binary classification degrades up to -19.9 F1 percentage points (pp), while 27-class emotion recognition gains up to +16.0pp; (2) Distilled reasoning variants underperform base models by 3-18 pp on simpler tasks, though few-shot prompting enables partial recovery; (3) Few-shot learning improves over zero-shot in most cases regardless of model type, with gains varying by architecture and task complexity; (4) Pareto frontier analysis shows base models dominate efficiency-performance trade-offs, with reasoning justified only for complex emotion recognition despite 2.1x-54x computational overhead. We complement these quantitative findings with qualitative error analysis revealing that reasoning degrades simpler tasks through systematic over-deliberation, offering mechanistic insight beyond the high-level overthinking hypothesis.

Abstract: Resource-efficient training optimization techniques are becoming increasingly important as the size of large language models (LLMs) continues to grow. In particular, batch packing is commonly used in pre-training and supervised fine-tuning to achieve resource-efficient training. We propose preference packing, a method to enhance resource efficiency in training techniques that use data with different responses for the same input prompt, such as reward models or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Preference packing improves resource efficiency by reducing the attention operations for duplicate input prompts and decreasing KV cache memory usage. We conducted experiments on text-only datasets and image-included datasets and achieved at least 37% reduction in training time. Notably, this method can be applied alongside existing optimization techniques such as batch sorting, resulting in a 3.22x speedup.

Abstract: Can narratives make arguments more persuasive? And to this end, which narrative features matter most? Although stories are often seen as powerful tools for persuasion, their specific role in online, unstructured argumentation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present ARGUS, a framework for studying the impact of narration on persuasion in argumentative discourse. ARGUS introduces a new ChangeMyView corpus annotated for story presence and six key narrative features, integrating insights from two established theoretical frameworks that capture both textual narrative features and their effects on recipients. Leveraging both encoder-based classifiers and zero-shot large language models (LLMs), ARGUS identifies stories and narrative features and applies them at scale to examine how different narrative dimensions influence persuasion success in online argumentation.

Abstract: This study presents the first systematic, reference-free human evaluation of large language model (LLM) machine translation (MT) for Ancient Greek (AG) technical prose. We evaluate translations by three commercial LLMs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) of twenty paragraph-length passages from two works by the Greek physician Galen of Pergamum (ca. 129-216 CE): On Mixtures, which has two published English translations, and On the Composition of Drugs according to Kinds, which has never been fully translated into English. We assess translation quality using both standard automated evaluation metrics (BLEU, chrF++, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, COMET, BLEURT) and expert human evaluation via a modified Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework applied to all 60 translations by a team of domain specialists. On the previously translated expository text, LLMs achieved high translation quality (mean MQM score 95.2/100), with performance approaching expert level. On the untranslated pharmacological text, aggregate quality was lower (79.9/100) but with high variance driven by two passages presenting extreme terminological density; excluding these, scores converged to within 4 points of the translated text. Terminology rarity, operationalized via corpus frequency in the literary Diorisis Ancient Greek Corpus, emerged as a strong predictor of translation failure (r = -.97 for passage-level quality on the untranslated text). Automated metrics showed moderate correlation with human judgment overall on the text with a wide quality spread (Composition), but no metric discriminated among high-quality translations. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs in Classical scholarship and for the design of automated evaluation pipelines for low-resource ancient languages.

Abstract: Mobile Agents can autonomously execute user instructions, which requires hybrid-capabilities reasoning, including screen summary, subtask planning, action decision and action function. However, existing agents struggle to achieve both decoupled enhancement and balanced integration of these capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Channel-of-Mobile-Experts (CoME), a novel agent architecture consisting of four distinct experts, each aligned with a specific reasoning stage, CoME activates the corresponding expert to generate output tokens in each reasoning stage via output-oriented activation. To empower CoME with hybrid-capabilities reasoning, we introduce a progressive training strategy: Expert-FT enables decoupling and enhancement of different experts' capability; Router-FT aligns expert activation with the different reasoning stage; CoT-FT facilitates seamless collaboration and balanced optimization across multiple capabilities. To mitigate error propagation in hybrid-capabilities reasoning, we propose InfoGain-Driven DPO (Info-DPO), which uses information gain to evaluate the contribution of each intermediate step, thereby guiding CoME toward more informative reasoning. Comprehensive experiments show that CoME outperforms dense mobile agents and MoE methods on both AITZ and AMEX datasets.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to large language models for task-specific applications. However, they are often employed in high-volume, low-latency settings, where efficiency is crucial. We propose TASC, Task-Adaptive Sequence Compression, a framework for SLM acceleration comprising two use-cases: When performing SLM fine-tuning, we propose TASC-ft, which iteratively enriches the tokenizer vocabulary with high-frequency output n-grams and then fine-tunes the model to utilize the expanded vocabulary. Next, we propose an inference-time method, termed TASC-spec. TASC-spec is a lightweight, training-free speculative decoding method that constructs an n-gram draft model from the task's output corpus, mixing task and context n-gram information.TASC-spec avoids any additional training, while bypassing draft-target vocabulary alignment constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods across multiple low output-variability generation tasks. Our methods show consistent improvements in inference efficiency while maintaining task performance.

Abstract: We present a scalable methodology for evaluating language models in multi-turn interactions, using a suite of collaborative games that require effective communication about private information. This enables an interactive scaling analysis, in which a fixed token budget is divided over a variable number of turns. We find that in many cases, language models are unable to use interactive collaboration to improve over the non-interactive baseline scenario in which one agent attempts to summarize its information and the other agent immediately acts -- despite substantial headroom. This suggests that state-of-the-art models still suffer from significant weaknesses in planning and executing multi-turn collaborative conversations. We analyze the linguistic features of these dialogues, assessing the roles of sycophancy, information density, and discourse coherence. While there is no single linguistic explanation for the collaborative weaknesses of contemporary language models, we note that humans achieve comparable task success at superior token efficiency by producing dialogues that are more coherent than those produced by most language models. The proactive management of private information is a defining feature of real-world communication, and we hope that MT-PingEval will drive further work towards improving this capability.

Abstract: AI agents powered by reasoning models require access to sensitive user data. However, their reasoning traces are difficult to control, which can result in the unintended leakage of private information to external parties. We propose training models to follow instructions not only in the final answer, but also in reasoning traces, potentially under different constraints. We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities. Overall, our results show that improving instruction-following behavior in reasoning models can significantly enhance privacy, suggesting a promising direction for the development of future privacy-aware agents.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with large language models typically retain the assistant's own past responses in the conversation history. In this work, we revisit this design choice by asking whether large language models benefit from conditioning on their own prior responses. Using in-the-wild, multi-turn conversations, we compare standard (full-context) prompting with a user-turn-only prompting approach that omits all previous assistant responses, across three open reasoning models and one state-of-the-art model. To our surprise, we find that removing prior assistant responses does not affect response quality on a large fraction of turns. Omitting assistant-side history can reduce cumulative context lengths by up to 10x. To explain this result, we find that multi-turn conversations consist of a substantial proportion (36.4%) of self-contained prompts, and that many follow-up prompts provide sufficient instruction to be answered using only the current user turn and prior user turns. When analyzing cases where user-turn-only prompting substantially outperforms full context, we identify instances of context pollution, in which models over-condition on their previous responses, introducing errors, hallucinations, or stylistic artifacts that propagate across turns. Motivated by these findings, we design a context-filtering approach that selectively omits assistant-side context. Our findings suggest that selectively omitting assistant history can improve response quality while reducing memory consumption.
