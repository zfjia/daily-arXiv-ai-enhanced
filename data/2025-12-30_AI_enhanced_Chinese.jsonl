Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic \"upsample-and-add\" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the \"artifacts\" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion).

However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales.

Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts.

A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions.

We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences.

Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC.

To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning.

To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting.

TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. We release model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code for transparent, reproducible Turkish encoder research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data.

We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation.

To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster - the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 News- groups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains.

Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities.

Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows.

Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines.

Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking.

With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images.

Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process.

In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens.

Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both \"excellent\" and \"poor\" grade descriptions while deviating from the \"good\" one. We refer to this phenomenon as \"semantic drift\", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks.

Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework.

Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation.

To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios.

To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold.

We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable.

We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score.

To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods.

However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures.

In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting.

To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task.

Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images.

From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal.

To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \\textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: \"Diffusion knows transparency.\" Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.
