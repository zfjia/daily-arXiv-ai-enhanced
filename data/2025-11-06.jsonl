However, these properties are not fully captured by\ndata augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on\ntransformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a\ntraining methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire\ninput space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training\nset to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which\nwe refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce\nfunctional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the\ntraining dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised\nmanner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled\nvirtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across\ndatasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently\noutperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On\npopular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%\ntop-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data\naugmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray\ndataset."}

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view\nsynthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely\ncaptured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting\ntheir practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three\nsparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,\nrendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity\nof input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of\ncamera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D\nreconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a\nprior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,\nfollowed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training\nefficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely\nsparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric\nconstraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering\nfidelity.

First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a\nlightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional\ndecomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order\nstatistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance\ntheir discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor\narchitecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss\nweights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial\ntraining phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of\ndiscriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of\nearly stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability\ntowards earlier stages as much as possible.

In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can\nincrease the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.\nConsequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently\nsevere that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin\ngrows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule\nthat preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to\nits alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a\nclosed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred\noutput is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,\nmodel-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks\nand adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image\nbenchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning\nbaselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Diffusion-SDPO."}

In this work, we\npropose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following\nability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from\nuser intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints,\ninstructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by\nenabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and\ntracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated\nuser's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the\ninteraction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving\ninstruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types.\nOur results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following\nperformance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and\ndemonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant\nmargin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code\nwill be made publicly available online."}

However, existing methods for social\ninteraction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic\nrepresentations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups\nwithout explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.\nThese drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and\nintroduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social\ninteractions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware\nbottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction\ndetection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions\nusing body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first\ndetects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then\ninfers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based\nreasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social\ncues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.\nExperiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior\nmethods, achieving the new state of the art."}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based\nExplainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions\nthrough disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We\ndefine motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large\nlanguage model to automatically extract object and scene concepts.

Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance.

In this paper, we demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in\nhuman-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:\nstack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,\nsimple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack\nof Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed\nby DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic\nstacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question\nformation task.

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target.
