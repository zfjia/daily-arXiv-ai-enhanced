Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Compared to its predecessor, the upgraded version exhibits substantial

in contextual ASR and highly competitive results in dialect-aware ASR. In image
generation, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces high-fidelity text rendering and
demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during
image editing. Furthermore, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces generative segmentation,
a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance
but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing
consistency. Notably, Ming-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art results in
text-to-image generation and generative segmentation, and sets new records on
all 12 contextual ASR benchmarks, all within a single unified architecture.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected

ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and

periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available
at https://github.com/scu-zwh/TGBFN.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in machine learning techniques on mobile
devices, particularly in the domain of computer vision, in this work we
quantitatively study the performance characteristics of 190 real-world vision
transformers (ViTs) on mobile devices. Through a comparison with 102 real-world
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we provide insights into the factors that
influence the latency of ViT architectures on mobile devices. Based on these
insights, we develop a dataset including measured latencies of 1000 synthetic
ViTs with representative building blocks and state-of-the-art architectures
from two machine learning frameworks and six mobile platforms. Using this
dataset, we show that inference latency of new ViTs can be predicted with
sufficient accuracy for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities
within the digital learning sphere. Within this context, our study delves into
a solution for online learning authentication, utilizing an enhanced
convolutional neural network architecture, specifically the residual network
model. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this technological approach
aims to galvanize the ongoing progress of online education, while concurrently
bolstering its security and stability. Such fortification is imperative in
enabling online education to seamlessly align with the swift evolution of the
educational landscape. This paper's focal proposition involves the deployment
of the YOLOv5 network, meticulously trained on our proprietary dataset. This
network is tasked with identifying individuals' faces culled from images
captured by students' open online cameras. The resultant facial information is
then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood
clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2
convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%
specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was
employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on
synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based
pre-diagnostic healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based

image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining

zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as

facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive

text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.
