Abstract: Generating multi-frame, action-rich visual narratives without fine-tuning faces a threefold tension: action text faithfulness, subject identity fidelity, and cross-frame background continuity. We propose StoryTailor, a zero-shot pipeline that runs on a single RTX 4090 (24 GB) and produces temporally coherent, identity-preserving image sequences from a long narrative prompt, per-subject references, and grounding boxes. Three synergistic modules drive the system: Gaussian-Centered Attention (GCA) to dynamically focus on each subject core and ease grounding-box overlaps; Action-Boost Singular Value Reweighting (AB-SVR) to amplify action-related directions in the text embedding space; and Selective Forgetting Cache (SFC) that retains transferable background cues, forgets nonessential history, and selectively surfaces retained cues to build cross-scene semantic ties. Compared with baseline methods, experiments show that CLIP-T improves by up to 10-15%, with DreamSim lower than strong baselines, while CLIP-I stays in a visually acceptable, competitive range. With matched resolution and steps on a 24 GB GPU, inference is faster than FluxKontext. Qualitatively, StoryTailor delivers expressive interactions and evolving yet stable scenes.

Abstract: Purpose: Curating large-scale datasets of operating room (OR) workflow, encompassing rare, safety-critical, or atypical events, remains operationally and ethically challenging. This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.
  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.
  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.
  Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations. Beyond demonstrating its capability to generate rare and safety-critical scenarios, we show its potential to support the development of ambient intelligence models.

Abstract: Instrumented Timed Up and Go (TUG) analysis can support clinical and research decision-making, but robust and reproducible markerless pipelines are still limited. We present \textit{tugturn.py}, a Python-based workflow for 3D markerless TUG processing that combines phase segmentation, gait-event detection, spatiotemporal metrics, intersegmental coordination, and dynamic stability analysis. The pipeline uses spatial thresholds to segment each trial into stand, first gait, turning, second gait, and sit phases, and applies a relative-distance strategy to detect heel-strike and toe-off events within valid gait windows. In addition to conventional kinematics, \textit{tugturn} provides Vector Coding outputs and Extrapolated Center of Mass (XCoM)-based metrics. The software is configured through TOML files and produces reproducible artifacts, including HTML reports, CSV tables, and quality-assurance visual outputs. A complete runnable example is provided with test data and command-line instructions. This manuscript describes the implementation, outputs, and reproducibility workflow of \textit{tugturn} as a focused software contribution for markerless biomechanical TUG analysis.

Abstract: Unified Vision-Language Models (UVLMs) aim to advance multimodal learning by supporting both understanding and generation within a single framework. However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation. The project page is at https://sqwu.top/AD-Loop.

Abstract: A key challenge in translating Visual Place Recognition (VPR) from the lab to long-term deployment is ensuring a priori that a system can meet user-specified performance requirements across different parts of an environment, rather than just on average globally. A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric.

Abstract: Existing 3D editing methods rely on computationally intensive scene-by-scene iterative optimization and suffer from multi-view inconsistency. We propose an effective and fully feedforward 3D editing framework based on the TRELLIS generative backbone, capable of modifying 3D models from a single editing view. Our framework addresses two key issues: adapting training-free 2D editing to structured 3D representations, and overcoming the bottleneck of appearance fidelity in compressed 3D features. To ensure geometric consistency, we introduce Voxel FlowEdit, an edit-driven flow in the sparse voxel latent space that achieves globally consistent 3D deformation in a single pass. To restore high-fidelity details, we develop a normal-guided single to multi-view generation module as an external appearance prior, successfully recovering high-frequency textures. Experiments demonstrate that our method enables fast, globally consistent, and high-fidelity 3D model editing.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction under unposed sparse viewpoints is a highly challenging yet practically important problem, especially in outdoor scenes due to complex lighting and scale variation. With extremely limited input views, directly utilizing diffusion model to synthesize pseudo frames will introduce unreasonable geometry, which will harm the final reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for sparse-view outdoor reconstruction that achieves high-quality results through bidirectional pseudo frame restoration and scene perception Gaussian management. Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm. Then we propose a scene perception Gaussian management strategy that optimize Gaussians based on joint depth-density information. These designs significantly enhance reconstruction completeness, suppress floating artifacts and improve overall geometric consistency under extreme view sparsity. Experiments on outdoor benchmarks demonstrate substantial gains over existing methods in both fidelity and stability.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding is essential for embodied intelligence, with occupancy prediction emerging as a key task for reasoning about both objects and free space. Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e.g., DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction. Our method extends surface points inward along camera rays to generate volumetric samples, which are represented as Gaussian primitives for probabilistic occupancy inference. To handle streaming input, we further design a training-free incremental update strategy that fuses per-frame Gaussians into a unified global representation. Experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet demonstrate significant gains: GPOcc improves mIoU by +9.99 in the monocular setting and +11.79 in the streaming setting over prior state of the art. Under the same depth prior, it achieves +6.73 mIoU while running 2.65$\times$ faster. These results highlight that GPOcc leverages geometry priors more effectively and efficiently. Code will be released at https://github.com/JuIvyy/GPOcc.

Abstract: Pose-guided human image animation aims to synthesize realistic videos of a reference character driven by a sequence of poses. While diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success, most existing approaches are limited to single-character animation. We observe that naively extending these methods to multi-character scenarios often leads to identity confusion and implausible occlusions between characters. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-character image animation, surpassing existing diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative image compression has demonstrated remarkable potential for achieving realistic reconstruction at ultra-low bitrates. The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost.

Abstract: Deep intracranial tumors situated in eloquent brain regions controlling vital functions present critical diagnostic challenges. Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.
  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts. Experiments demonstrate over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20%.

Abstract: Hand motion plays a central role in human interaction, yet modeling realistic 4D hand motion (i.e., 3D hand pose sequences over time) remains challenging. Research in this area is typically divided into two tasks: (1) Estimation approaches reconstruct precise motion from visual observations, but often fail under hand occlusion or absence; (2) Generation approaches focus on synthesizing hand poses by exploiting generative priors under multi-modal structured inputs and infilling motion from incomplete sequences. However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons. Visual observations are encoded with a frozen vision backbone, while a dedicated hand perceptron extracts hand-specific cues directly from image features, removing the need for complex detection and cropping pipelines. A latent diffusion model then synthesizes consistent motion sequences from these diverse conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UniHand delivers robust and accurate hand motion modeling, maintaining performance under severe occlusions and temporally incomplete inputs.

Abstract: Modeling 4D scenes requires capturing both spatial structure and temporal motion, which is challenging due to the need for physically consistent representations of complex rigid and non-rigid motions. Existing approaches mainly rely on translational displacements, which struggle to represent rotations, articulated transformations, often leading to spatial inconsistency and physically implausible motion. LieFlow, a dynamic radiance representation framework that explicitly models motion within the SE(3) Lie group, enabling coherent learning of translation and rotation in a unified geometric space. The SE(3) transformation field enforces physically inspired constraints to maintain motion continuity and geometric consistency. The evaluation includes a synthetic dataset with rigid-body trajectories and two real-world datasets capturing complex motion under natural lighting and occlusions. Across all datasets, LieFlow consistently improves view-synthesis fidelity, temporal coherence, and physical realism over NeRF-based baselines. These results confirm that SE(3)-based motion modeling offers a robust and physically grounded framework for representing dynamic 4D scenes.

Abstract: Learning-based point cloud compression presents superior performance to handcrafted codecs. However, pretrained-based methods, which are based on end-to-end training and expected to generalize to all the potential samples, suffer from training data dependency. Implicit neural representation (INR) based methods are distribution-agnostic and more robust, but they require time-consuming online training and suffer from the bitstream overhead from the overfitted model. To address these limitations, we propose HybridINR-PCGC, a novel hybrid framework that bridges the pretrained model and INR. Our framework retains distribution-agnostic properties while leveraging a pretrained network to accelerate convergence and reduce model overhead, which consists of two parts: the Pretrained Prior Network (PPN) and the Distribution Agnostic Refiner (DAR). We leverage the PPN, designed for fast inference and stable performance, to generate a robust prior for accelerating the DAR's convergence. The DAR is decomposed into a base layer and an enhancement layer, and only the enhancement layer needed to be packed into the bitstream. Finally, we propose a supervised model compression module to further supervise and minimize the bitrate of the enhancement layer parameters. Based on experiment results, HybridINR-PCGC achieves a significantly improved compression rate and encoding efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 20.43% compared to G-PCC on 8iVFB. In the challenging out-of-distribution scenario Cat1B, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 57.85% compared to UniPCGC. And our method exhibits a superior time-rate trade-off, achieving an average Bpp reduction of 15.193% relative to the LINR-PCGC on 8iVFB.

Abstract: Generative AI is widely used to create commercial posters. However, rapid advances in generation have outpaced automated quality assessment. Existing models emphasize generic esthetics or low level distortions and lack the functional criteria required for e-commerce design. It is especially challenging for Chinese content, where complex characters often produce subtle but critical textual artifacts that are overlooked by existing methods. To address this, we introduce E-comIQ-ZH, a framework for evaluating Chinese e-commerce posters. We build the first dataset E-comIQ-18k to feature multi dimensional scores and expert calibrated Chain of Thought (CoT) rationales. Using this dataset, we train E-comIQ-M, a specialized evaluation model that aligns with human expert judgment. Our framework enables E-comIQ-Bench, the first automated and scalable benchmark for the generation of Chinese e-commerce posters. Extensive experiments show our E-comIQ-M aligns more closely with expert standards and enables scalable automated assessment of e-commerce posters. All datasets, models, and evaluation tools will be released to support future research in this area.Code will be available at https://github.com/4mm7/E-comIQ-ZH.

Abstract: A U-Net based deep learning architecture is designed to segment brain tumors as they appear on various MRI modalities. Special emphasis is lent to the non-enhancing tumor compartment. The latter has not been considered anymore in recent brain tumor segmentation challenges like the MICCAI challenges. However, it is considered to be indicative of the survival time of the patient as well as of areas of further tumor growth. Hence it deems essential to have means to automatically delineate its extension within the tumor.

Abstract: Tooth image segmentation is a cornerstone of dental digitization. However, traditional image encoders relying on fixed-resolution feature maps often lead to discontinuous segmentation and poor discrimination between target regions and background, due to insufficient modeling of environmental and global context. Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.
  We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. On the OralVision dataset, our model achieves a 1.1% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU).

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) for colonoscopy is hampered by the domain gap between simulated and real-world images. Existing image-to-image translation methods, which use depth as a posterior constraint, often produce structural distortions and specular highlights by failing to balance realism with structure consistency. To address this, we propose a Structure-to-Image paradigm that transforms the depth map from a passive constraint into an active generative foundation. We are the first to introduce phase congruency to colonoscopic domain adaptation and design a cross-level structure constraint to co-optimize geometric structures and fine-grained details like vascular textures. In zero-shot evaluations conducted on a publicly available phantom dataset, the MDE model that was fine-tuned on our generated data achieved a maximum reduction of 44.18% in RMSE compared to competing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/YyangJJuan/PC-S2I.git.

Abstract: Advanced autonomous systems rely on multi-sensor fusion for safer and more robust perception. To enable effective fusion, calibrating directly from natural driving scenes (i.e., target-free) with high accuracy is crucial for precise multi-sensor alignment. Existing learning-based calibration methods are typically designed for only a single pair of sensor modalities (i.e., a bi-modal setup). Unlike these methods, we propose LiREC-Net, a target-free, learning-based calibration network that jointly calibrates multiple sensor modality pairs, including LiDAR, RGB, and event data, within a unified framework. To reduce redundant computation and improve efficiency, we introduce a shared LiDAR representation that leverages features from both its 3D nature and projected depth map, ensuring better consistency across modalities. Trained and evaluated on established datasets, such as KITTI and DSEC, our LiREC-Net achieves competitive performance to bi-modal models and sets a new strong baseline for the tri-modal use case.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for deepfake detection excel at identifying spatial artifacts but overlook a critical dimension: temporal inconsistencies in video forgeries. Adapting VLMs to reason about these dynamic cues remains a distinct challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs.

Abstract: Object hallucination is a critical issue in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where outputs include objects that do not appear in the input image. A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lingfengren/NoLan.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic visual experiences from brain activity provides a compelling avenue for exploring the neural mechanisms of human visual perception. While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.

Abstract: Visual storytelling models that correctly ground entities in images may still hallucinate semantic relationships, generating incorrect dialogue attribution, character interactions, or emotional states. We introduce StoryMovie, a dataset of 1,757 stories aligned with movie scripts and subtitles through LCS matching. Our alignment pipeline synchronizes screenplay dialogue with subtitle timestamps, enabling dialogue attribution by linking character names from scripts to temporal positions from subtitles. Using this aligned content, we generate stories that maintain visual grounding tags while incorporating authentic character names, dialogue, and relationship dynamics. We fine-tune Qwen Storyteller3 on this dataset, building on prior work in visual grounding and entity re-identification. Evaluation using DeepSeek V3 as judge shows that Storyteller3 achieves an 89.9% win rate against base Qwen2.5-VL 7B on subtitle alignment. Compared to Storyteller, trained without script grounding,
  Storyteller3 achieves 48.5% versus 38.0%, confirming that semantic alignment progressively improves dialogue attribution beyond visual grounding alone.

Abstract: Video foundation models aim to integrate video understanding, generation, editing, and instruction following within a single framework, making them a central direction for next-generation multimodal systems. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve. Extensive human annotations ensure our evaluation aligns with human judgment, enabling rigorous assessment and accelerating progress toward robust video intelligence.

Abstract: Deep learning-based watermarking has made remarkable progress in recent years. To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \underline{\textbf{s}}ingle \underline{\textbf{r}}andom \underline{\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \underline{\textbf{meta}}-learning with \underline{\textbf{f}}eature \underline{\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\%, 4.71\%, and 2.38\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.

Abstract: Accurate annotation of endoscopic videos is essential yet time-consuming, particularly for challenging datasets such as dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, where the affected regions are irregular and lack clear boundaries. Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt (L2RP), a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input. By tuning a human-cost parameter, our method balances annotation effort and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on a private Barrett's dysplasia dataset and the public SUN-SEG benchmark demonstrate improved temporal consistency and superior performance over baseline strategies.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) facilitates the secure utilization of decentralized images, advancing applications in medical image recognition and autonomous driving. However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that GFPL improves model accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data settings while maintaining low communication cost.

Abstract: Image memorability, i.e., how likely an image is to be remembered, has traditionally been studied in computer vision either as a passive prediction task, with models regressing a scalar score, or with generative methods altering the visual input to boost the image likelihood of being remembered. Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., "emphasize facial expression," "bring the subject forward"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores. Our experiments, considering multiple MLLMs, demonstrate the effectiveness of MemCoach, showing consistently improved performance over several zero-shot models. The results indicate that memorability can not only be predicted but also taught and instructed, shifting the focus from mere prediction to actionable feedback for human creators.

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation plays a critical role in the navigation of endoscopic surgical robots, forming the foundation for 3D reconstruction and safe instrument guidance. Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness. This demonstrates the potential of our method to reduce visual errors in complex endoscopic environments. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yinheng-lin/EndoDDC.

Abstract: Clouds are a major obstacle in Earth observation, limiting the usability and reliability of critical remote sensing applications such as fire disaster response, urban heat island monitoring, and snow and ice cover mapping. Therefore, the ability to detect clouds 24/7 is of paramount importance. While visible and near-infrared bands are effective for daytime cloud detection, their dependence on solar illumination makes them unsuitable for nighttime monitoring. In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands. Despite this, accurate nighttime cloud detection remains challenging due to limited spectral information and the typically lower spatial resolution of TIR imagery. To address these challenges, we present TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset centered around thermal spectral data to facilitate cloud segmentation under both daytime and nighttime conditions. The dataset comprises a unique combination of multispectral data (TIR, optical, and near-infrared bands) from Landsat and VIIRS, aligned with auxiliary information layers. Elevation, land cover, meteorological variables, and cloud-free reference images are included to help reduce surface-cloud ambiguity and cloud formation uncertainty. To overcome the scarcity of manual cloud labels, we include a large set of samples with automated cloud masks and a smaller manually annotated subset to further evaluate and improve models. Comprehensive benchmarks are presented to establish performance baselines through supervised and transfer learning, demonstrating the dataset's value in advancing the development of innovative methods for day and night time cloud detection.

Abstract: We present a geometry-aware method for heterogeneous single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction that predicts atomic backbone conformations. To incorporate protein-structure priors, we represent the backbone as a graph and use a graph neural network (GNN) autodecoder that maps per-image latent variables to 3D displacements of a template conformation. The objective combines a data-discrepancy term based on a differentiable cryo-EM forward model with geometric regularization, and it supports unknown orientations via ellipsoidal support lifting (ESL) pose estimation. On synthetic datasets derived from molecular dynamics trajectories, the proposed GNN achieves higher accuracy compared to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of comparable size, highlighting the benefits of a geometry-informed inductive bias.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a key predictor of cardiovascular risk, but it relies on ECG-gated CT scans, restricting its use to specialized cardiac imaging settings. We introduce an automated framework for CAC detection and lesion-specific Agatston scoring that operates across both gated and non-gated CT scans. At its core is CARD-ViT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer trained exclusively on gated CT data using DINO. Without any non-gated training data, our framework achieves 0.707 accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.528 on the Stanford non-gated dataset, matching models trained directly on non-gated scans. On gated test sets, the framework achieves 0.910 accuracy with Cohen's kappa scores of 0.871 and 0.874 across independent datasets, demonstrating robust risk stratification. These results demonstrate the feasibility of cross-domain CAC scoring from gated to non-gated domains, supporting scalable cardiovascular screening in routine chest imaging without additional scans or annotations.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) progresses as a continuous and irreversible deterioration of the retina, following a well-defined clinical trajectory from mild to severe stages. However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions. This mechanism aligns the feature representation with the natural trajectory of DR worsening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ODR yields superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art ordinal regression and DR-specific grading methods, offering a more clinically reliable assessment of disease severity. Our code is available on https://github.com/HovChen/D-ODR.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision impairment worldwide. However, manual diagnosis is often time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in screening. This paper presents a lightweight automated deep learning framework for efficient assessment of DR severity from digital fundus images. We use a MobileNetV3 architecture with a Consistent Rank Logits (CORAL) head to model the ordered progression of disease while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained environments. The model is trained and validated on a combined dataset of APTOS 2019 and IDRiD images using a preprocessing pipeline including circular cropping and illumination normalization. Extensive experiments including 3-fold cross-validation and ablation studies demonstrate strong performance. The model achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) score of 0.9019 and an accuracy of 80.03 percent. Additionally, we address real-world deployment challenges through model calibration to reduce overconfidence and optimization for mobile devices. The proposed system provides a scalable and practical tool for early-stage diabetic retinopathy screening.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide, making early and accurate DR grading critical for timely intervention. Recent clinical practices leverage multi-view fundus images for DR detection with a wide coverage of the field of view (FOV), motivating deep learning methods to explore the potential of multi-view learning for DR grading. However, existing methods often overlook the inter-view correlations when fusing multi-view fundus images, failing to fully exploit the inherent consistency across views originating from the same patient. In this work, we present MVGFDR, an end-to-end Multi-View Graph Fusion framework for DR grading. Different from existing methods that directly fuse visual features from multiple views, MVGFDR is equipped with a novel Multi-View Graph Fusion (MVGF) module to explicitly disentangle the shared and view-specific visual features. Specifically, MVGF comprises three key components: (1) Multi-view Graph Initialization, which constructs visual graphs via residual-guided connections and employs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as frequency-domain anchors; (2) Multi-view Graph Fusion, which integrates selective nodes across multi-view graphs based on frequency-domain relevance to capture complementary view-specific information; and (3) Masked Cross-view Reconstruction, which leverages masked reconstruction of shared information across views to facilitate view-invariant representation learning. Extensive experimental results on MFIDDR, by far the largest multi-view fundus image dataset, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches in diabetic retinopathy grading.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLM) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, showing promise for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as VLM's widely used reasoning strategy, is facing critical challenges. Existing textual CoT has a large gap between text semantic space and trajectory physical space. Although the recent approach utilizes future image to replace text as CoT process, it lacks clear planning-oriented objective guidance to generate images with accurate scene evolution. To address these, we innovatively propose MindDriver, a progressive multimodal reasoning framework that enables VLM to imitate human-like progressive thinking for autonomous driving. MindDriver presents semantic understanding, semantic-to-physical space imagination, and physical-space trajectory planning. To achieve aligned reasoning processes in MindDriver, we develop a feedback-guided automatic data annotation pipeline to generate aligned multimodal reasoning training data. Furthermore, we develop a progressive reinforcement fine-tuning method to optimize the alignment through progressive high- level reward-based learning. MindDriver demonstrates superior performance in both nuScences open-loop and Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation. Codes are available at https://github.com/hotdogcheesewhite/MindDriver.

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate text embedded in images in the source-language into target-language, requiring synergistic integration of visual perception and linguistic understanding. Existing TIMT methods, whether cascaded pipelines or end-to-end multimodal large language models (MLLMs),struggle with high-resolution text-rich images due to cluttered layouts, diverse fonts, and non-textual distractions, resulting in text omission, semantic drift, and contextual inconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework for MLLM-based TIMT. GLoTran integrates a low-resolution global image with multi-scale region-level text image slices under an instruction-guided alignment strategy, conditioning MLLMs to maintain scene-level contextual consistency while faithfully capturing fine-grained textual details. Moreover, to realize this dual-perception paradigm, we construct GLoD, a large-scale text-rich TIMT dataset comprising 510K high-resolution global-local image-text pairs covering diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GLoTran substantially improves translation completeness and accuracy over state-of-the-art MLLMs, offering a new paradigm for fine-grained TIMT under high-resolution and text-rich conditions.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading technique for efficiently fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models, and its widespread adoption on open-source platforms has fostered a vibrant culture of model sharing and customization. However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of "trigger word-target image" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%. MasqLoRA reveals a severe and unique threat in the AI supply chain, underscoring the urgent need for dedicated defense mechanisms for the LoRA-centric sharing ecosystem.

Abstract: Medical images are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and research, but their quality is often degraded by noise from low-dose acquisition, patient motion, or scanner limitations, affecting both clinical interpretation and downstream analysis. Traditional filtering approaches often over-smooth and lose fine anatomical details, while deep learning methods, including CNNs, GANs, and transformers, may struggle to preserve such details or require large, computationally expensive models, limiting clinical practicality.
  We propose PatchDenoiser, a lightweight, energy-efficient multi-scale patch-based denoising framework. It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.
  On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.
  PatchDenoiser thus provides a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance, robustness, and clinical deployability.

Abstract: Vision-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to jointly retrieve relevant visual documents and generate grounded answers based on multimodal evidence. However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) of outdoor scenes is crucial for relighting, editing, and understanding large-scale environments, but progress has been limited by the lack of real-world datasets with reliable albedo and shading supervision. We introduce Olbedo, a large-scale aerial dataset for outdoor albedo--shading decomposition in the wild. Olbedo contains 5,664 UAV images captured across four landscape types, multiple years, and diverse illumination conditions. Each view is accompanied by multi-view consistent albedo and shading maps, metric depth, surface normals, sun and sky shading components, camera poses, and, for recent flights, measured HDR sky domes. These annotations are derived from an inverse-rendering refinement pipeline over multi-view stereo reconstructions and calibrated sky illumination, together with per-pixel confidence masks. We demonstrate that Olbedo enables state-of-the-art diffusion-based IID models, originally trained on synthetic indoor data, to generalize to real outdoor imagery: fine-tuning on Olbedo significantly improves single-view outdoor albedo prediction on the MatrixCity benchmark. We further illustrate applications of Olbedo-trained models to multi-view consistent relighting of 3D assets, material editing, and scene change analysis for urban digital twins. We release the dataset, baseline models, and an evaluation protocol to support future research in outdoor intrinsic decomposition and illumination-aware aerial vision.

Abstract: Metro trains often operate in highly complex environments, characterized by illumination variations, high-speed motion, and adverse weather conditions. These factors pose significant challenges for visual perception systems, especially those relying solely on conventional RGB cameras. To tackle these difficulties, we explore the integration of event cameras into the perception system, leveraging their advantages in low-light conditions, high-speed scenarios, and low power consumption. Specifically, we focus on Kilometer Marker Recognition (KMR), a critical task for autonomous metro localization under GNSS-denied conditions. In this context, we propose a robust baseline method based on a pre-trained RGB OCR foundation model, enhanced through multi-modal adaptation. Furthermore, we construct the first large-scale RGB-Event dataset, EvMetro5K, containing 5,599 pairs of synchronized RGB-Event samples, split into 4,479 training and 1,120 testing samples. Extensive experiments on EvMetro5K and other widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for KMR. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EvMetro5K_benchmark

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking has attracted increasing attention due to its human-friendly interactive characteristics, yet it exhibits limitations in low-visibility conditions, such as nighttime, smoke, and other challenging scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new RGB-Thermal RMOT task, named RT-RMOT, which aims to fuse RGB appearance features with the illumination robustness of the thermal modality to enable all-day referring multi-object tracking. To promote research on RT-RMOT, we construct the first Referring Multi-Object Tracking dataset under RGB-Thermal modality, named RefRT. It contains 388 language descriptions, 1,250 tracked targets, and 166,147 Language-RGB-Thermal (L-RGB-T) triplets. Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential. To alleviate training instability during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a Clipped Advantage Scaling (CAS) strategy to suppress gradient explosion. In addition, we design Structured Output Reward and Comprehensive Detection Reward to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the completeness and accuracy of target perception. Extensive experiments on the RefRT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTrack framework.

Abstract: Automating garment assembly from sewing patterns remains a significant challenge due to the lack of standardized annotation protocols and the frequent absence of semantic cues. Existing methods often rely on panel labels or handcrafted heuristics, which limit their applicability to real-world, non-conforming patterns. We present AutoSew, a fully automatic, geometry-based approach for predicting stitch correspondences directly from 2D pattern contours. AutoSew formulates the problem as a graph matching task, leveraging a Graph Neural Network to capture local and global geometric context, and employing a differentiable optimal transport solver to infer stitching relationships-including multi-edge connections. To support this task, we update the GarmentCodeData dataset modifying over 18k patterns with realistic multi-edge annotations, reflecting industrial assembly scenarios. AutoSew achieves 96% F1-score and successfully assembles 73.3% of test garments without error, outperforming existing methods while relying solely on geometric input. Our results demonstrate that geometry alone can robustly guide stitching prediction, enabling scalable garment assembly without manual input.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting aims to localize fast-paced actions or events in videos with high temporal precision, a key task for applications in sports analytics, robotics, and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

Abstract: Ego-centric driving videos available online provide an abundant source of visual data for autonomous driving, yet their lack of annotations makes it difficult to learn representations that capture both semantic structure and 3D geometry. Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Editable high-fidelity 4D scenes are crucial for autonomous driving, as they can be applied to end-to-end training and closed-loop simulation. However, existing reconstruction methods are primarily limited to replicating observed scenes and lack the capability for diverse weather simulation. While image-level weather editing methods tend to introduce scene artifacts and offer poor controllability over the weather effects. To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds. To tackle the challenge of multi-weather modeling, we introduce a novel weather Gaussian representation based on shared scene features and dedicated weather-specific decoders. This representation is further enhanced with a content consistency optimization, ensuring coherent modeling across different weather conditions. Additionally, we design a physics-driven model that simulates dynamic weather effects through particles and motion patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and various scenes demonstrate that WeatherCity achieves flexible controllability, high fidelity, and temporal consistency in 4D reconstruction and weather editing. Our framework not only enables fine-grained control over weather conditions (e.g., light rain and heavy snow) but also supports object-level manipulation within the scene.

Abstract: Current medical vision-language models (VLMs) process volumetric brain MRI using 2D slice-based approximations, fragmenting the spatial context required for accurate neuroradiological interpretation. We developed \textbf{Brain3D}, a staged vision-language framework for automated radiology report generation from 3D brain tumor MRI. Our approach inflates a pretrained 2D medical encoder into a native 3D architecture and progressively aligns it with a causal language model through three stages: contrastive grounding, supervised projector warmup, and LoRA-based linguistic specialization. Unlike generalist 3D medical VLMs, \textbf{Brain3D} is tailored to neuroradiology, where hemispheric laterality, tumor infiltration patterns, and anatomical localization are critical. Evaluated on 468 subjects (BraTS pathological cases plus healthy controls), our model achieves a Clinical Pathology F1 of 0.951 versus 0.413 for a strong 2D baseline while maintaining perfect specificity on healthy scans. The staged alignment proves essential: contrastive grounding establishes visual-textual correspondence, projector warmup stabilizes conditioning, and LoRA adaptation shifts output from verbose captions to structured clinical reports\footnote{Our code is publicly available for transparency and reproducibility

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are rapidly gaining popularity, yet their outputs often lack geographical diversity, reinforce stereotypes, and misrepresent regions. Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have greatly improved visual understanding and reasoning, yet their quadratic attention and offline training protocols make them ill-suited for streaming settings where frames arrive sequentially and future observations are inaccessible. We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pretraining increasingly relies on medical reports as large-scale supervisory signals; however, raw reports often exhibit substantial stylistic heterogeneity, variable length, and a considerable amount of image-irrelevant content. Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Arturia-Pendragon-Iris/MedTri.

Abstract: Arbitrary-Scale SR (ASISR) remains fundamentally limited by cross-scale distribution shift: once the inference scale leaves the training range, noise, blur, and artifacts accumulate sharply. We revisit this challenge from a cross-scale distribution transition perspective and propose CASR, a simple yet highly efficient cyclic SR framework that reformulates ultra-magnification as a sequence of in-distribution scale transitions. This design ensures stable inference at arbitrary scales while requiring only a single model. CASR tackles two major bottlenecks: distribution drift across iterations and patch-wise diffusion inconsistencies. The proposed SDAM module aligns structural distributions via superpixel aggregation, preventing error accumulation, while SARM module restores high-frequency textures by enforcing autocorrelation and embedding LR self-similarity priors. Despite using only a single model, our approach significantly reduces distribution drift, preserves long-range texture consistency, and achieves superior generalization even at extreme magnification.

Abstract: In recent years, a standard computational pathology workflow has emerged where whole slide images are cropped into tiles, these tiles are processed using a foundation model, and task-specific models are built using the resulting representations. At least 15 different foundation models have been proposed, and the vast majority are trained exclusively with tiles using the 20$\times$ magnification. However, it is well known that certain histologic features can only be discerned with larger context windows and requires a pathologist to zoom in and out when analyzing a whole slide image. Furthermore, creating 224$\times$224 pixel crops at 20$\times$ leads to a large number of tiles per slide, which can be gigapixel in size. To more accurately capture multi-resolution features and investigate the possibility of reducing the number of representations per slide, we propose a region-level mixing encoder. Our approach jointly fuses image tile representations of a mixed magnification foundation model using a masked embedding modeling pretraining step. We explore a design space for pretraining the proposed mixed-magnification region aggregators and evaluate our models on transfer to biomarker prediction tasks representing various cancer types. Results demonstrate cancer dependent improvements in predictive performance, highlighting the importance of spatial context and understanding.

Abstract: Existing action-conditioned video generation models (video world models) are limited to single-agent perspectives, failing to capture the multi-agent interactions of real-world environments. We introduce Solaris, a multiplayer video world model that simulates consistent multi-view observations. To enable this, we develop a multiplayer data system designed for robust, continuous, and automated data collection on video games such as Minecraft. Unlike prior platforms built for single-player settings, our system supports coordinated multi-agent interaction and synchronized videos + actions capture. Using this system, we collect 12.64 million multiplayer frames and propose an evaluation framework for multiplayer movement, memory, grounding, building, and view consistency. We train Solaris using a staged pipeline that progressively transitions from single-player to multiplayer modeling, combining bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training. In the final stage, we introduce Checkpointed Self Forcing, a memory-efficient Self Forcing variant that enables a longer-horizon teacher. Results show our architecture and training design outperform existing baselines. Through open-sourcing our system and models, we hope to lay the groundwork for a new generation of multi-agent world models.

Abstract: Egocentric manipulation videos are highly challenging due to severe occlusions during interactions and frequent object entries and exits from the camera view as the person moves. Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction. Project website: https://judyye.github.io/whole-www

Abstract: Temporally consistent surface reconstruction of dynamic 3D objects from unstructured point cloud data remains challenging, especially for very long sequences. Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors. Experiments across diverse human and animal datasets demonstrate that Neu-PiG outperforms state-the-art approaches, offering both superior accuracy and scalability to long sequences while running at least 60x faster than existing training-free methods and achieving inference speeds on the same order as heavy pretrained models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Token-level steering has emerged as a pivotal approach for inference-time alignment, enabling fine grained control over large language models by modulating their output distributions without parameter updates. While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x.

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning methods like LoRA have enabled task specific adaptation of large language models, but efficiently composing multiple specialized adapters for unseen tasks remains challenging. We present a novel framework for dynamic LoRA adapter composition that leverages similarity retrieval in vector databases to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse NLP tasks. Our approach constructs a task-aware vector database by embedding training examples from 22 datasets spanning commonsense reasoning, question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. At inference time, we retrieve the most similar training examples, compute task similarity distributions via nucleus sampling, and dynamically merge relevant LoRA adapters using retrieval weighted fusion strategies. We evaluated four merging methods Linear, Concatenation, TIES, and Magnitude Prune demonstrating that our dataset centric retrieval approach often matches or exceeds the performance of individually fine-tuned task-specific adapters. Notably, Linear merging achieves 70.95% on PIQA and 77.62% on RTE, substantially outperforming single-task baselines (46% and 52%, respectively). Our framework requires no additional retriever training, operates with frozen embeddings, and enables efficient, interpretable adapter composition. These results suggest that retrieval based dynamic merging offers a promising direction for scalable, parameter-efficient multitask learning without requiring full model retraining for each new task.

Abstract: It is not only what we ask large language models (LLMs) to do that matters, but also how we prompt. Phrases like "This is urgent" or "As your supervisor" can shift model behavior without altering task content. We study this effect as pragmatic framing, contextual cues that shape directive interpretation rather than task specification. While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive. This work establishes pragmatic framing as a measurable and predictable factor in instruction-following systems.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a pivotal technique to accelerate LLM inference by employing a lightweight draft model to generate candidate tokens that are subsequently verified by the target model in parallel. However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization. We conducted extensive evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents that execute long-horizon workflows, invoking a high-capability model at every step becomes economically unsustainable. While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints. Overall, our work establishes a foundational framework for agentic routing, shifting the paradigm from static model selection to dynamic, budget-aware sequential decision-making.

Abstract: We introduce \ToolMATH, a math-grounded benchmark that evaluates tool-augmented language models in realistic multi-tool environments where the output depends on calling schema-specified tools and sustaining multi-step execution. It turns math problems into a controlled, correctness-checkable benchmark with tool sets, enabling systematic evaluation of model reliability under (1) large, overlapping tool catalogs and (2) the absence of the intended capability. \ToolMATH provides actionable diagnostic evidence of failure modes in tool-augmented agents, helping identify the control mechanisms required for robustness. \ToolMATH roughly contains 8k questions and 12k tools; we provide an additional hard-set \ToolMATHHard with questions and tools. Our evaluation reveals that the key failure factor is due to the inability to reason, leading to the accumulation of intermediate results' errors and constrain later decisions. Tool-list redundancy do not simply add noise, but amplify small early deviations into irreversible execution drift. The benchmark highlights that when the intended capability is missing, distractor tools can sometimes serve as partial substitutes in solution paths, yet they can also mislead models into ungrounded tool trajectories. Finally, comparisons between tool-use protocols emphasize that improvements come less from local action selection and more from long-range plan coherence and disciplined use of observations.

Abstract: Extracting clinical information from medical transcripts in low-resource languages remains a significant challenge in healthcare natural language processing (NLP). This study evaluates a two-step pipeline combining Aya-expanse-8B as a Persian-to-English translation model with five open-source small language models (SLMs) -- Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-1B-it -- for binary extraction of 13 clinical features from 1,221 anonymized Persian transcripts collected at a cancer palliative care call center. Using a few-shot prompting strategy without fine-tuning, models were assessed on macro-averaged F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, and specificity to account for class imbalance. Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct achieved the highest overall performance (median macro-F1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797), while Gemma-3-1B-it showed the weakest results. Larger models (7B--8B parameters) consistently outperformed smaller counterparts in sensitivity and MCC. A bilingual analysis of Aya-expanse-8B revealed that translating Persian transcripts to English improved sensitivity, reduced missing outputs, and boosted metrics robust to class imbalance, though at the cost of slightly lower specificity and precision. Feature-level results showed reliable extraction of physiological symptoms across most models, whereas psychological complaints, administrative requests, and complex somatic features remained challenging. These findings establish a practical, privacy-preserving blueprint for deploying open-source SLMs in multilingual clinical NLP settings with limited infrastructure and annotation resources, and highlight the importance of jointly optimizing model scale and input language strategy for sensitive healthcare applications.

Abstract: Bangla-English code-mixing is widespread across South Asian social media, yet resources for implicit meaning identification in this setting remain scarce. Existing sentiment and sarcasm models largely focus on monolingual English or high-resource languages and struggle with transliteration variation, cultural references, and intra-sentential language switching. To address this gap, we introduce MixSarc, the first publicly available Bangla-English code-mixed corpus for implicit meaning identification. The dataset contains 9,087 manually annotated sentences labeled for humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, and vulgarity. We construct the corpus through targeted social media collection, systematic filtering, and multi-annotator validation. We benchmark transformer-based models and evaluate zero-shot large language models under structured prompting. Results show strong performance on humor detection but substantial degradation on sarcasm, offense, and vulgarity due to class imbalance and pragmatic complexity. Zero-shot models achieve competitive micro-F1 scores but low exact match accuracy. Further analysis reveals that over 42\% of negative sentiment instances in an external dataset exhibit sarcastic characteristics. MixSarc provides a foundational resource for culturally aware NLP and supports more reliable multi-label modeling in code-mixed environments.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated capabilities in text generation, while their increasing parameter scales present challenges in computational and memory efficiency. Post-training sparsity (PTS), which reduces model cost by removing weights from dense networks, is an effective approach. However, native dense matrices lack high sparsity, making existing approaches that directly remove weights disrupt model states, resulting in unsatisfactory performance recovery even with post-tuning. We propose Sparsity Induction, which promotes models toward higher sparsity at both distribution and feature levels before pruning, to push the limits of PTS. At the distribution level, we enhance distributional sparsity through mathematically equivalent scaling transformations, which are fully absorbable and incur no extra parameters or inference-time overhead. At the feature level, we introduce Spectral Norm Loss to promote feature sparsity from a low-rank perspective. Experiments across diverse model architectures and tasks demonstrate that our method further enhances sparsity-friendliness, achieving superior pruning performance over existing approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human recursive numeral systems (i.e., counting systems such as English base-10 numerals), like many other grammatical systems, are highly regular. Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence.

Abstract: We describe our end-to-end system for Bengali long-form speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization submitted to the DL Sprint 4.0 competition on Kaggle. Bengali presents substantial challenges for both tasks: a large phoneme inventory, significant dialectal variation, frequent code-mixing with English, and a relative scarcity of large-scale labelled corpora. For ASR we achieve a best private Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.37738 and public WER of 0.36137, combining a BengaliAI fine-tuned Whisper medium model with Demucs source separation for vocal isolation, silence-boundary chunking, and carefully tuned generation hyperparameters. For speaker diarization we reach a best private Diarization Error Rate (DER) of 0.27671 and public DER of 0.20936 by replacing the default segmentation model inside the pyannote.audio pipeline with a Bengali-fine-tuned variant, pairing it with wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM embeddings and centroid-based agglomerative clustering. Our experiments demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning of the segmentation component, vocal source separation, and natural silence-aware chunking are the three most impactful design choices for low-resource Bengali speech processing.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance in handling interleaved image-text data, assessing their few-shot learning capabilities remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce FewMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs under few-shot conditions, with a focus on In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Covering a diverse suite of multimodal understanding tasks, from attribute recognition to temporal reasoning, FewMMBench enables systematic analysis across task types, model families, and prompting strategies. We evaluate 26 open-weight MLLMs from six model families across zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT-augmented few-shot settings. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuned models exhibit strong zero-shot performance but benefit minimally, or even regress, with additional demonstrations or CoT reasoning. Retrieval-based demonstrations and increased context size also yield limited gains. These results highlight FewMMBench as a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing few-shot capabilities in multimodal LLMs. The data is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mustafaa/FewMMBench

Abstract: Sarcasm detection in multilingual and code-mixed environments remains a challenging task for natural language processing models due to structural variations, informal expressions, and low-resource linguistic availability. This study compares four large language models, Llama 3.1, Mistral, Gemma 3, and Phi-4, with a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for sarcasm detection in code-mixed Hinglish text. The results indicate that the smaller, sequentially fine-tuned DistilBERT model achieved the highest overall accuracy of 84%, outperforming all of the LLMs in zero and few-shot set ups, using minimal LLM generated code-mixed data used for fine-tuning. These findings indicate that domain-adaptive fine-tuning of smaller transformer based models may significantly improve sarcasm detection over general LLM inference, in low-resource and data scarce settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable breadth of knowledge, yet their ability to reason about computational processes remains poorly understood. Closing this gap matters for practitioners who rely on LLMs to guide algorithm selection and deployment. We address this limitation using causal discovery as a testbed and evaluate eight frontier LLMs against ground truth derived from large-scale algorithm executions and find systematic, near-total failure. Models produce ranges far wider than true confidence intervals yet still fail to contain the true algorithmic mean in the majority of instances; most perform worse than random guessing and the marginal above-random performance of the best model is most consistent with benchmark memorization rather than principled reasoning. We term this failure algorithmic blindness and argue it reflects a fundamental gap between declarative knowledge about algorithms and calibrated procedural prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized inference across diverse natural language tasks, with larger models performing better but at higher computational costs. We propose a confidence-driven strategy that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on confidence estimates. By assessing a model's confidence in handling the task and response accuracy, tasks that are likely to be solved correctly are retained, while more uncertain or complex cases are delegated to a larger model, ensuring reliability while minimizing computation. Specifically, we evaluate a model's likelihood of knowing the correct answer and the probability that its response is accurate. Experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to the largest model while reducing computational costs by 20\% to 40\%. When applied to GPT-4o API calls, it reduces token usage by approximately 60\%, further improving cost efficiency. These findings indicate the potential of confidence-based model selection to enhance real-world LLM deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as edge devices and commercial API applications.

Abstract: The inability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to modulate their personality expression in response to evolving dialogue dynamics hinders their performance in complex, interactive contexts. We propose a model-agnostic framework for dynamic personality simulation that employs state machines to represent latent personality states, where transition probabilities are dynamically adapted to the conversational context. Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting. Results demonstrate that the system successfully adapts its personality state to user inputs, but also influences user behavior, thereby facilitating de-escalation training. Notably, the scoring pipeline maintains comparable precision even when utilizing lightweight, fine-tuned classifiers instead of large-scale LLMs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of modular, personality-adaptive architectures for education, customer support, and broader human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Over the last twenty years, significant progress has been made in designing and implementing Question Answering (QA) systems. However, addressing complex questions, the answers to which are spread across multiple documents, remains a challenging problem. Recent QA systems that are designed to handle complex questions work either on the basis of knowledge graphs, or utilise contem- porary neural models that are expensive to train, in terms of both computational resources and the volume of training data required. In this paper, we present LiCQA, an unsupervised question answer- ing model that works primarily on the basis of corpus evidence. We empirically compare the effectiveness and efficiency of LiCQA with two recently presented QA systems, which are based on different underlying principles. The results of our experiments show that LiCQA significantly outperforms these two state-of-the-art systems on benchmark data with noteworthy reduction in latency.

Abstract: We study reasoning for accessing world knowledge stored in a language model's parameters. For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple "think step-by-step" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math. Motivated by this, we propose training models to reason over their parametric knowledge using world-knowledge question answering as a verifiable reward. After reinforcement learning on TriviaQA (+9.9%), performance also improves on Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA by 4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, and 3.0%, respectively. Reasoning models are under-optimized for parametric knowledge access, but can be easily trained to reason better.

Abstract: Sumerian transliteration is a conventional system for representing a scholar's interpretation of a tablet in the Latin script. Thanks to visionary digital Assyriology projects such as ETCSL, CDLI, and Oracc, a large number of Sumerian transliterations have been published online, and these data are well-structured for a variety of search and analysis tasks. However, the absence of a comprehensive, accessible dataset pairing transliterations with a digital representation of the tablet's cuneiform glyphs has prevented the application of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to the task of Sumerian transliteration.
  To address this gap, we present SumTablets, a dataset pairing Unicode representations of 91,606 Sumerian cuneiform tablets (totaling 6,970,407 glyphs) with the associated transliterations published by Oracc. We construct SumTablets by first preprocessing and standardizing the Oracc transliterations before mapping each reading back to the Unicode representation of the source glyph. Further, we retain parallel structural information (e.g., surfaces, newlines, broken segments) through the use of special tokens. We release SumTablets as a Hugging Face Dataset (CC BY 4.0) and open source data preparation code via GitHub.
  Additionally, we leverage SumTablets to implement and evaluate two transliteration baselines: (1) weighted sampling from a glyph's possible readings, and (2) fine-tuning an autoregressive language model. Our fine-tuned language model achieves an average transliteration character-level F-score (chrF) of 97.55, demonstrating the immediate potential of transformer-based transliteration models in allowing experts to rapidly verify generated transliterations rather than manually transliterating tablets one-by-one.
