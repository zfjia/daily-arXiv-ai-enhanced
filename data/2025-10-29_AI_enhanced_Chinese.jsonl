Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves\nremarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to\ndownstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current\nmethods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by\ngradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during\nfine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located\nweights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which\nresults in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the\noptimizer.

For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates\nthe weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two\nlow-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by\nintroducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the\nresulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,\nenabling better adaptation to downstream tasks.

To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations.

Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy\nand histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely\ntime-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of\ndigital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in\nenhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a\nconvolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized\nfor the classification of colorectal tissue images.

With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2\neffectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness\nof the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified\ncross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and\nNCT-CRC-HE-100K.

In camera-guided video generation\nwith a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with\nthe generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address\nthis, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire\nsequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of\nthe predefined camera trajectory.
