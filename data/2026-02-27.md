Abstract: Foundation models in histopathology are expected to facilitate the development of high-performing and generalisable deep learning systems. However, current models capture not only biologically relevant features, but also pre-analytic and scanner-specific variation that bias the predictions of task-specific models trained from the foundation model features. Here we show that introducing novel robustness losses during training of downstream task-specific models reduces sensitivity to technical variability. A purpose-designed comprehensive experimentation setup with 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients is used to train thousands of models from the features of eight popular foundation models for computational pathology. In addition to a substantial improvement in robustness, we observe that prediction accuracy improves by focusing on biologically relevant features. Our approach successfully mitigates robustness issues of foundation models for computational pathology without retraining the foundation models themselves, enabling development of robust computational pathology models applicable to real-world data in routine clinical practice.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel medical image segmentation framework, MNAS-Unet, which combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). MNAS-Unet dynamically explores promising network architectures through MCTS, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of architecture search. It also optimizes the DownSC and UpSC unit structures, enabling fast and precise model adjustments. Experimental results demonstrate that MNAS-Unet outperforms NAS-Unet and other state-of-the-art models in segmentation accuracy on several medical image datasets, including PROMISE12, Ultrasound Nerve, and CHAOS. Furthermore, compared with NAS-Unet, MNAS-Unet reduces the architecture search budget by 54% (early stopping at 139 epochs versus 300 epochs under the same search setting), while achieving a lightweight model with only 0.6M parameters and lower GPU memory consumption, which further improves its practical applicability. These results suggest that MNAS-Unet can improve search efficiency while maintaining competitive segmentation accuracy under practical resource constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D scene reconstruction have significantly improved dynamic modeling across various domains. However, existing approaches remain limited under aerial conditions with single-view capture, wide spatial range, and dynamic objects of limited spatial footprint and large motion disparity. These challenges cause severe depth ambiguity and unstable motion estimation, making monocular aerial reconstruction inherently ill-posed. To this end, we present AeroDGS, a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos. AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module that reconstructs reliable static and dynamic geometry from a single aerial sequence, providing a robust basis for dynamic estimation. To further resolve monocular ambiguity, we propose a Physics-Guided Optimization module that incorporates differentiable ground-support, upright-stability, and trajectory-smoothness priors, transforming ambiguous image cues into physically consistent motion. The framework jointly refines static backgrounds and dynamic entities with stable geometry and coherent temporal evolution. We additionally build a real-world UAV dataset that spans various altitudes and motion conditions to evaluate dynamic aerial reconstruction. Experiments on synthetic and real UAV scenes demonstrate that AeroDGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity in dynamic aerial environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate prediction of malignancy in renal tumors is crucial for informing clinical decisions and optimizing treatment strategies. However, existing imaging modalities lack the necessary accuracy to reliably predict malignancy before surgical intervention. While deep learning has shown promise in malignancy prediction using 3D CT images, traditional approaches often rely on manual segmentation to isolate the tumor region and reduce noise, which enhances predictive performance. Manual segmentation, however, is labor-intensive, costly, and dependent on expert knowledge. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed utilizing an Organ Focused Attention (OFA) loss function to modify the attention of image patches so that organ patches attend only to other organ patches. Hence, no segmentation of 3D renal CT images is required at deployment time for malignancy prediction. The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.685 and an F1-score of 0.872 on a private dataset from the UF Integrated Data Repository (IDR), and an AUC of 0.760 and an F1-score of 0.852 on the publicly available KiTS21 dataset. These results surpass the performance of conventional models that rely on segmentation-based cropping for noise reduction, demonstrating the frameworks ability to enhance predictive accuracy without explicit segmentation input. The findings suggest that this approach offers a more efficient and reliable method for malignancy prediction, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making in renal cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs), when pre-trained on large-scale data, provide general-purpose representations for diverse downstream tasks. However, artifacts in ViTs are widely observed across different supervision paradigms and downstream tasks. Through systematic analysis of artifacts in ViTs, we find that their fundamental mechanisms have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. In this paper, through systematic analysis, we conclude that these artifacts originate from a lazy aggregation behavior: ViT uses semantically irrelevant background patches as shortcuts to represent global semantics, driven by global attention and Coarse-grained semantic supervision. Our solution selectively integrates patch features into the CLS token, reducing the influence of background-dominated shortcuts and consistently improving performance across 12 benchmarks under label-, text-, and self-supervision. We hope this work offers a new perspective on ViT behavior.

Abstract: CLIP models learn transferable multi-modal features via image-text contrastive learning on internet-scale data. They are widely used in zero-shot classification, multi-modal retrieval, text-to-image diffusion, and as image encoders in large vision-language models. However, CLIP's pretraining is dominated by images paired with short captions, biasing the model toward encoding simple descriptions of salient objects and leading to coarse alignment on complex scenes and dense descriptions. While recent work mitigates this by fine-tuning on small-scale long-caption datasets, we identify an important common bias: both human- and LLM-generated long captions typically begin with a one-sentence summary followed by a detailed description. We show that this acts as a shortcut during training, concentrating attention on the opening sentence and early tokens and weakening alignment over the rest of the caption. To resolve this, we introduce DeBias-CLIP, which removes the summary sentence during training and applies sentence sub-sampling and text token padding to distribute supervision across all token positions. DeBias-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art long-text retrieval, improves short-text retrieval, and is less sensitive to sentence order permutations. It is a drop-in replacement for Long-CLIP with no additional trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a critical question regarding their visual grounding mechanism remains unanswered: do these models genuinely ``read'' text embedded in images, or do they merely rely on parametric shortcuts in the text prompt? In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications. On four representative OOD benchmarks, it surpasses the base model by 5.4% and GRPO based on original images by 2.7%, while exhibiting extreme data efficiency, achieving superior performance with 30x fewer samples (8.5K) than recent RL-based methods. Furthermore, its plug-and-play nature allows seamless integration with advanced RL strategies like NoisyRollout to yield complementary improvements. Code is available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SimpleOCR.

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for real-time online episodic memory question answering. While cloud offloading is common, it raises privacy and latency concerns for wearable assistants, hence we investigate implementation on the edge. We integrated streaming constraints into our question answering pipeline, which is structured into two asynchronous threads: a Descriptor Thread that continuously converts video into a lightweight textual memory, and a Question Answering (QA) Thread that reasons over the textual memory to answer queries. Experiments on the QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark analyze the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) within strict resource boundaries, showing promising results also when compared to clound-based solutions. Specifically, an end-to-end configuration running on a consumer-grade 8GB GPU achieves 51.76% accuracy with a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 0.41s. Scaling to a local enterprise-grade server yields 54.40% accuracy with a TTFT of 0.88s. In comparison, a cloud-based solution obtains an accuracy of 56.00%. These competitive results highlight the potential of edge-based solutions for privacy-preserving episodic memory retrieval.

Abstract: Screening mammography is high volume, time sensitive, and documentation heavy. Radiologists must translate subtle visual findings into consistent BI-RADS assessments, breast density categories, and structured narrative reports. While recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) enable image-to-text reporting, many rely on closed cloud systems or tightly coupled architectures that limit privacy, reproducibility, and adaptability. We present MammoWise, a local multi-model pipeline that transforms open source VLMs into mammogram report generators and multi-task classifiers. MammoWise supports any Ollama-hosted VLM and mammography dataset, and enables zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting, with optional multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using a vector database for case-specific context. We evaluate MedGemma, LLaVA-Med, and Qwen2.5-VL on VinDr-Mammo and DMID datasets, assessing report quality (BERTScore, ROUGE-L), BI-RADS classification, breast density, and key findings. Report generation is consistently strong and improves with few-shot prompting and RAG. Classification is feasible but sensitive to model and dataset choice. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) of MedGemma improves reliability, achieving BI-RADS accuracy of 0.7545, density accuracy of 0.8840, and calcification accuracy of 0.9341 while preserving report quality. MammoWise provides a practical and extensible framework for deploying local VLMs for mammography reporting within a unified and reproducible workflow.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently hallucinate objects absent from the input image. We trace this failure to spatial credit collapse: activation credit concentrating on sparse visual patches in early transformer layers, which suppresses contextual evidence and increases reliance on language priors. We introduce Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), a training-free inference-time intervention that redistributes hidden-state activation from high-attention source patches to their context, guided by low-entropy inputs. We evaluate six model families (Chameleon, LLaVA, and Qwen, including both Qwen-VL and Qwen2-VL) at scales of 7B, 13B, and 30B, on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks. SCR reduces hallucination by ~4.7-6.0 percentage points on POPE-Adversarial, cuts CHAIR-s by 3.7-5.2 percentage points (42-51 percent relative), and CHAIR-i by 2.7-4.4 percentage points (44-58 percent relative), and preserves CIDEr within 0.8 percentage points. Gains are largest for low-entropy inputs, consistent with the theoretical framework. SCR incurs only 43-56 ms overhead (small models: +43-46 ms; large models: +54-56 ms), roughly 3-6 times lower than OPERA and VCD and 1.3-1.7 times lower than OVCD (+72 ms), while Pareto-dominating all three on both hallucination rate and CIDEr, making it practical for real-time settings. A controlled ablation confirms that attention-guided source selection is essential: replacing it with uniform random selection reduces hallucination rate gains from ~4.7-6.0 percentage points to only ~2.6-3.4 percentage points, pointing to credit-collapse as the key driver.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) uses a reference image plus a natural-language edit to retrieve images that apply the requested change while preserving other relevant visual content. Classic fusion pipelines typically rely on supervised triplets and can lose fine-grained cues, while recent zero-shot approaches often caption the reference image and merge the caption with the edit, which may miss implicit user intent and return repetitive results. We present Pix2Key, which represents both queries and candidates as open-vocabulary visual dictionaries, enabling intent-aware constraint matching and diversity-aware reranking in a unified embedding space. A self-supervised pretraining component, V-Dict-AE, further improves the dictionary representation using only images, strengthening fine-grained attribute understanding without CIR-specific supervision. On the DFMM-Compose benchmark, Pix2Key improves Recall@10 up to 3.2 points, and adding V-Dict-AE yields an additional 2.3-point gain while improving intent consistency and maintaining high list diversity.

Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) provides an in vivo marker of Alzheimer's disease pathology, but cost and limited availability motivate MRI-based alternatives. We introduce DisQ-HNet (DQH), a framework that synthesizes tau-PET from paired T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI while exposing how each modality contributes to the prediction. The method combines (i) a Partial Information Decomposition (PID)-guided, vector-quantized encoder that partitions latent information into redundant, unique, and complementary components, and (ii) a Half-UNet decoder that preserves anatomical detail using pseudo-skip connections conditioned on structural edge cues rather than direct encoder feature reuse. Across multiple baselines (VAE, VQ-VAE, and UNet), DisQ-HNet maintains reconstruction fidelity and better preserves disease-relevant signal for downstream AD tasks, including Braak staging, tau localization, and classification. PID-based Shapley analysis provides modality-specific attribution of synthesized uptake patterns.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Synthesis of diverse driving scenes serves as a crucial data augmentation technique for validating the robustness and generalizability of autonomous driving systems. Current methods aggregate high-definition (HD) maps and 3D bounding boxes as geometric conditions in diffusion models for conditional scene generation. However, implicit inter-condition dependency causes generation failures when control conditions change independently. Additionally, these methods suffer from insufficient details in both semantic and structural aspects. Specifically, brief and view-invariant captions restrict semantic contexts, resulting in weak background modeling. Meanwhile, the standard denoising loss with uniform spatial weighting neglects foreground structural details, causing visual distortions and blurriness. To address these challenges, we propose DrivePTS, which incorporates three key innovations. Firstly, our framework adopts a progressive learning strategy to mitigate inter-dependency between geometric conditions, reinforced by an explicit mutual information constraint. Secondly, a Vision-Language Model is utilized to generate multi-view hierarchical descriptions across six semantic aspects, providing fine-grained textual guidance. Thirdly, a frequency-guided structure loss is introduced to strengthen the model's sensitivity to high-frequency elements, improving foreground structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DrivePTS achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scenes. Notably, DrivePTS successfully generates rare scenes where prior methods fail, highlighting its strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Depth-guided 3D reconstruction has gained popularity as a fast alternative to optimization-heavy approaches, yet existing methods still suffer from scale drift, multi-view inconsistencies, and the need for substantial refinement to achieve high-fidelity geometry. Here, we propose SwiftNDC, a fast and general framework built around a Neural Depth Correction field that produces cross-view consistent depth maps. From these refined depths, we generate a dense point cloud through back-projection and robust reprojection-error filtering, obtaining a clean and uniformly distributed geometric initialization for downstream reconstruction. This reliable dense geometry substantially accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mesh reconstruction, enabling high-quality surfaces with significantly fewer optimization iterations. For novel-view synthesis, SwiftNDC can also improve 3DGS rendering quality, highlighting the benefits of strong geometric initialization. We conduct a comprehensive study across five datasets, including two for mesh reconstruction, as well as three for novel-view synthesis. SwiftNDC consistently reduces running time for accurate mesh reconstruction and boosts rendering fidelity for view synthesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining neural depth refinement with robust geometric initialization for high-fidelity and efficient 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Deep multi-view clustering has achieved remarkable progress but remains vulnerable to complex noise in real-world applications. Existing noisy robust methods predominantly rely on a simplified binary assumption, treating data as either perfectly clean or completely corrupted. This overlooks the prevalent existence of heterogeneous observation noise, where contamination intensity varies continuously across data. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed Quality-Aware Robust Multi-View Clustering (QARMVC). Specifically, QARMVC employs an information bottleneck mechanism to extract intrinsic semantics for view reconstruction. Leveraging the insight that noise disrupts semantic integrity and impedes reconstruction, we utilize the resulting reconstruction discrepancy to precisely quantify fine-grained contamination intensity and derive instance-level quality scores. These scores are integrated into a hierarchical learning strategy: at the feature level, a quality-weighted contrastive objective is designed to adaptively suppress the propagation of noise; at the fusion level, a high-quality global consensus is constructed via quality-weighted aggregation, which is subsequently utilized to align and rectify local views via mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that QARMVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous noise intensities.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has helped diffusion models achieve great conditional generation in various fields. Recently, more diffusion guidance methods have emerged with improved generation quality and human preference. However, can these emerging diffusion guidance methods really achieve solid and significant improvements? In this paper, we rethink recent progress on diffusion guidance. Our work mainly consists of four contributions. First, we reveal a critical evaluation pitfall that common human preference models exhibit a strong bias towards large guidance scales. Simply increasing the CFG scale can easily improve quantitative evaluation scores due to strong semantic alignment, even if image quality is severely damaged (e.g., oversaturation and artifacts). Second, we introduce a novel guidance-aware evaluation (GA-Eval) framework that employs effective guidance scale calibration to enable fair comparison between current guidance methods and CFG by identifying the effects orthogonal and parallel to CFG effects. Third, motivated by the evaluation pitfall, we design Transcendent Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that can significantly improve human preference scores in the conventional evaluation framework but actually does not work in practice. Fourth, in extensive experiments, we empirically evaluate recent eight diffusion guidance methods within the conventional evaluation framework and the proposed GA-Eval framework. Notably, simply increasing the CFG scales can compete with most studied diffusion guidance methods, while all methods suffer severely from winning rate degradation over standard CFG. Our work would strongly motivate the community to rethink the evaluation paradigm and future directions of this field.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction offers substantial runtime advantages over per-scene optimization, which remains slow at inference and often fragile under sparse views. However, existing feed-forward methods still have potential for further performance gains, especially for out-of-domain data, and struggle to retain second-level inference time once a generative prior is introduced. These limitations stem from the one-shot prediction paradigm in existing feed-forward pipeline: models are strictly bounded by capacity, lack inference-time refinement, and are ill-suited for continuously injecting generative priors. We introduce GIFSplat, a purely feed-forward iterative refinement framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting from sparse unposed views. A small number of forward-only residual updates progressively refine current 3D scene using rendering evidence, achieve favorable balance between efficiency and quality. Furthermore, we distill a frozen diffusion prior into Gaussian-level cues from enhanced novel renderings without gradient backpropagation or ever-increasing view-set expansion, thereby enabling per-scene adaptation with generative prior while preserving feed-forward efficiency. Across DL3DV, RealEstate10K, and DTU, GIFSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines, improving PSNR by up to +2.1 dB, and it maintains second-scale inference time without requiring camera poses or any test-time gradient optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion diffusion models have substantially improved the realism of human motion synthesis. However, existing approaches either rely on full-sequence diffusion models with bidirectional generation, which limits temporal causality and real-time applicability, or autoregressive models that suffer from instability and cumulative errors. In this work, we present Causal Motion Diffusion Models (CMDM), a unified framework for autoregressive motion generation based on a causal diffusion transformer that operates in a semantically aligned latent space. CMDM builds upon a Motion-Language-Aligned Causal VAE (MAC-VAE), which encodes motion sequences into temporally causal latent representations. On top of this latent representation, an autoregressive diffusion transformer is trained using causal diffusion forcing to perform temporally ordered denoising across motion frames. To achieve fast inference, we introduce a frame-wise sampling schedule with causal uncertainty, where each subsequent frame is predicted from partially denoised previous frames. The resulting framework supports high-quality text-to-motion generation, streaming synthesis, and long-horizon motion generation at interactive rates. Experiments on HumanML3D and SnapMoGen demonstrate that CMDM outperforms existing diffusion and autoregressive models in both semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness, while substantially reducing inference latency.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years. The YOLO series of detectors is among the most well-known CNN-based object detection models and cannot be overlooked. The latest version, YOLOv26, was recently released, while YOLOv12 achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 55.2 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, transformer-based object detection models, also known as DEtection TRansformer (DETR), have demonstrated impressive performance. RT-DETR is an outstanding model that outperformed the YOLO series in both speed and accuracy when it was released. Its successor, RT-DETRv2, achieved 53.4 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. However, despite their remarkable performance, all these models let information to slip away. They primarily focus on the features of foreground objects while neglecting the contextual information provided by the background. We believe that background information can significantly aid object detection tasks. For example, cars are more likely to appear on roads rather than in offices, while wild animals are more likely to be found in forests or remote areas rather than on busy streets. To address this gap, we propose an object detection model called Association DETR, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other object detection models on the COCO val2017 dataset.

BetterScene leverages the production-ready Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model pretrained on billions of frames as a strong backbone, aiming to mitigate artifacts and recover view-consistent details at inference time. Conventional methods have developed similar diffusion-based solutions to address these challenges of novel view synthesis. Despite significant improvements, these methods typically rely on off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion priors and fine-tune only the UNet module while keeping other components frozen, which still leads to inconsistent details and artifacts even when incorporating geometry-aware regularizations like depth or semantic conditions. To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline. BetterScene integrates a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features as inputs for the SVD enhancer and generate continuous, artifact-free, consistent novel views. We evaluate on the challenging DL3DV-10K dataset and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present LoR-LUT, a unified low-rank formulation for compact and interpretable 3D lookup table (LUT) generation. Unlike conventional 3D-LUT-based techniques that rely on fusion of basis LUTs, which are usually dense tensors, our unified approach extends the current framework by jointly using residual corrections, which are in fact low-rank tensors, together with a set of basis LUTs. The approach described here improves the existing perceptual quality of an image, which is primarily due to the technique's novel use of residual corrections. At the same time, we achieve the same level of trilinear interpolation complexity, using a significantly smaller number of network, residual corrections, and LUT parameters. The experimental results obtained from LoR-LUT, which is trained on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, reproduce expert-level retouching characteristics with high perceptual fidelity and a sub-megabyte model size. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive visualization tool, termed LoR-LUT Viewer, which transforms an input image into the LUT-adjusted output image, via a number of slidebars that control different parameters. The tool provides an effective way to enhance interpretability and user confidence in the visual results. Overall, our proposed formulation offers a compact, interpretable, and efficient direction for future LUT-based image enhancement and style transfer.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) promise zero-shot and retrieval understanding for Earth observation. While operational satellite systems often lack full multi-spectral coverage, making RGB-only inference highly desirable for scalable deployment, the adoption of VLFMs for satellite imagery remains hindered by two factors: (1) multi-spectral inputs are informative but difficult to exploit consistently due to band redundancy and misalignment; and (2) CLIP-style text encoders limit semantic expressiveness and weaken fine-grained alignment. We present SATtxt, a spectrum-aware VLFM that operates with RGB inputs only at inference while retaining spectral cues learned during training. Our framework comprises two stages. First, Spectral Representation Distillation transfers spectral priors from a frozen multi-spectral teacher to an RGB student via a lightweight projector. Second, Spectrally Grounded Alignment with Instruction-Augmented LLMs bridges the distilled visual space and an expressive LLM embedding space. Across EuroSAT, BigEarthNet, and ForestNet, SATtxt improves zero-shot classification on average by 4.2%, retrieval by 5.9%, and linear probing by 2.7% over baselines, showing an efficient path toward spectrum-aware vision-language learning for Earth observation.

Abstract: We propose Coded-E2LF (coded event to light field), a computational imaging method for acquiring a 4-D light field using a coded aperture and a stationary event-only camera. In a previous work, an imaging system similar to ours was adopted, but both events and intensity images were captured and used for light field reconstruction. In contrast, our method is purely event-based, which relaxes restrictions for hardware implementation. We also introduce several advancements from the previous work that enable us to theoretically support and practically improve light field reconstruction from events alone. In particular, we clarify the key role of a black pattern in aperture coding patterns. We finally implemented our method on real imaging hardware to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing real 3-D scenes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that a 4-D light field with pixel-level accuracy can be reconstructed from events alone. Our software and supplementary video are available from our project website.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection (SF-DAOD) aims to adapt a detector trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without retaining any source data. Despite recent progress, most popular approaches focus on tuning pseudo-label thresholds or refining the teacher-student framework, while overlooking object-level structural cues within cross-domain data. In this work, we present CGSA, the first framework that brings Object-Centric Learning (OCL) into SF-DAOD by integrating slot-aware adaptation into the DETR-based detector. Specifically, our approach integrates a Hierarchical Slot Awareness (HSA) module into the detector to progressively disentangle images into slot representations that act as visual priors. These slots are then guided toward class semantics via a Class-Guided Slot Contrast (CGSC) module, maintaining semantic consistency and prompting domain-invariant adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous SF-DAOD methods, with theoretical derivations and experimental analysis further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed components and the framework, thereby indicating the promise of object-centric design in privacy-sensitive adaptation scenarios. Code is released at https://github.com/Michael-McQueen/CGSA.

Abstract: Editing images via instruction provides a natural way to generate interactive content, but it is a big challenge due to the higher requirement of scene understanding and generation. Prior work utilizes a chain of large language models, object segmentation models, and editing models for this task. However, the understanding models provide only a single modality ability, restricting the editing quality. We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i.e., Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning, editing region reasoning, and editing. For Chain-of-Thought planning, the large language model could reason the appropriate sub-prompts considering the instruction provided and the ability of the editing network. For editing region reasoning, we train an instruction-based editing region generation network with a multi-modal large language model. Finally, a hint-guided instruction-based editing network is proposed for editing image generations based on the sizeable text-to-image diffusion model to accept the hints for generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has competitive editing abilities on complex real-world images.

Abstract: Most existing 3D assembly methods treat the problem as pure pose estimation, rearranging observed parts via rigid transformations. In contrast, human assembly naturally couples structural reasoning with holistic shape inference. Inspired by this intuition, we reformulate 3D assembly as a joint problem of assembly and generation. We show that these two processes are mutually reinforcing: assembly provides part-level structural priors for generation, while generation injects holistic shape context that resolves ambiguities in assembly. Unlike prior methods that cannot synthesize missing geometry, we propose CRAG, which simultaneously generates plausible complete shapes and predicts poses for input parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across in-the-wild objects with diverse geometries, varying part counts, and missing pieces. Our code and models will be released.

Abstract: In structure from motion, quadrifocal tensors capture more information than their pairwise counterparts (essential matrices), yet they have often been thought of as impractical and only of theoretical interest. In this work, we challenge such beliefs by providing a new framework to recover $n$ cameras from the corresponding collection of quadrifocal tensors. We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares. We further establish relationships between the block quadrifocal, trifocal, and bifocal tensors, and introduce an algorithm that jointly synchronizes these three entities. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on modern datasets, indicating the potential and importance of using higher-order information in synchronization.

Abstract: Missing modalities present a fundamental challenge in multimodal models, often causing catastrophic performance degradation. Our observations suggest that this fragility stems from an imbalanced learning process, where the model develops an implicit preference for certain modalities, leading to the under-optimization of others. We propose a simple yet efficient method to address this challenge. The central insight of our work is that the dominance relationship between modalities can be effectively discerned and quantified in the frequency domain. To leverage this principle, we first introduce a Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference by analyzing features in the frequency domain. Guided by FRM, we then propose a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module, a plug-and-play component that dynamically re-balances the contribution of each branch during training, promoting a more holistic learning paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MWAM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse architectural backbones, such as those based on CNNs and ViTs. Furthermore, MWAM delivers consistent performance gains across a wide range of tasks and modality combinations. This advancement extends beyond merely optimizing the performance of the base model; it also manifests as further performance improvements to state-of-the-art methods addressing the missing modality problem.

Abstract: Interactive Medical-SAM2 GUI is an open-source desktop application for semi-automatic annotation of 2D and 3D medical images. Built on the Napari multi-dimensional viewer, box/point prompting is integrated with SAM2-style propagation by treating a 3D volume as a slice sequence, enabling mask propagation from sparse prompts using Medical-SAM2 on top of SAM2. Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline. To address this practical limitation, a local-first Napari workflow is provided for efficient 3D annotation across multiple studies using standard DICOM series and/or NIfTI volumes. Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving. During export, per-object volumetry and 3D volume rendering are supported, and image geometry is preserved via SimpleITK. The GUI is implemented in Python using Napari and PyTorch, with optional N4 bias-field correction, and is intended exclusively for research annotation workflows. The code is released on the project page: https://github.com/SKKU-IBE/Medical-SAM2GUI/.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image and video generation, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the substantial computational overhead of multi-step iterative sampling. Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework.

Abstract: Audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) research has been stalled by limitations of existing datasets: they are typically small in scale, with insufficient diversity in content and quality, and annotated only with overall scores. These shortcomings provide limited support for model development and multimodal perception research. We propose a practical approach for AVQA dataset construction. First, we design a crowdsourced subjective experiment framework for AVQA, breaks the constraints of in-lab settings and achieves reliable annotation across varied environments. Second, a systematic data preparation strategy is further employed to ensure broad coverage of both quality levels and semantic scenarios. Third, we extend the dataset with additional annotations, enabling research on multimodal perception mechanisms and their relation to content. Finally, we validate this approach through YT-NTU-AVQ, the largest and most diverse AVQA dataset to date, consisting of 1,620 user-generated audio and video (A/V) sequences. The dataset and platform code are available at https://github.com/renyu12/YT-NTU-AVQ

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects into high-fidelity digital twins is crucial for applications such as robotic manipulation and interactive simulation. Recent self-supervised methods using differentiable rendering frameworks like 3D Gaussian Splatting remain highly sensitive to the initial part segmentation. Their reliance on heuristic clustering or pre-trained models often causes optimization to converge to local minima, especially for complex multi-part objects. To address these limitations, we propose ArtPro, a novel self-supervised framework that introduces adaptive integration of mobility proposals. Our approach begins with an over-segmentation initialization guided by geometry features and motion priors, generating part proposals with plausible motion hypotheses. During optimization, we dynamically merge these proposals by analyzing motion consistency among spatial neighbors, while a collision-aware motion pruning mechanism prevents erroneous kinematic estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world objects demonstrate that ArtPro achieves robust reconstruction of complex multi-part objects, significantly outperforming existing methods in accuracy and stability.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D occupancy is vital for embodied agents, which need to understand complex indoor environments where semantic categories are abundant and evolve beyond fixed taxonomies. While recent work has explored open-vocabulary occupancy in outdoor driving scenarios, such methods transfer poorly indoors, where geometry is denser, layouts are more intricate, and semantics are far more fine-grained. To address these challenges, we adopt a geometry-only supervision paradigm that uses only binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free). Our framework builds upon 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians, which serve as a unified intermediate representation coupling fine-grained 3D geometry with a language-aligned semantic embedding. On the geometry side, we find that existing Gaussian-to-Occupancy operators fail to converge under such weak supervision, and we introduce an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach that stabilizes volumetric aggregation. On the semantic side, direct alignment between rendered features and open-vocabulary segmentation features suffers from feature mixing; we therefore propose a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule that gradually sharpens opacities during splatting, strengthening Gaussian-language alignment. On Occ-ScanNet, our framework achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU in the open-vocabulary setting, surpassing all existing occupancy methods in IoU and outperforming prior open-vocabulary approaches by a large margin in mIoU. Code will be released at https://github.com/JuIvyy/LegoOcc.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is a critical yet challenging research problem owing to severe light attenuation, color distortion, background clutter, and the small scale of underwater targets. To address these challenges, we propose SPMamba-YOLO, a novel underwater object detection network that integrates multi-scale feature enhancement with global context modeling. Specifically, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling Enhanced Layer Aggregation Network (SPPELAN) module is introduced to strengthen multi-scale feature aggregation and expand the receptive field, while a Pyramid Split Attention (PSA) mechanism enhances feature discrimination by emphasizing informative regions and suppressing background interference. In addition, a Mamba-based state space modeling module is incorporated to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and global contextual information, thereby improving detection robustness in complex underwater environments. Extensive experiments on the URPC2022 dataset demonstrate that SPMamba-YOLO outperforms the YOLOv8n baseline by more than 4.9\% in mAP@0.5, particularly for small and densely distributed underwater objects, while maintaining a favorable balance between detection accuracy and computational cost.

Abstract: Image-text retrieval has become a fundamental component in intelligent multimedia systems; however, most existing vision-language models are optimized for highresource languages and remain suboptimal for low-resource settings such as Vietnamese. This work introduces ViCLIP-OT, a foundation vision-language model specifically designed for Vietnamese image-text retrieval. The proposed framework integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with a Similarity-Graph Regularized Optimal Transport (SIGROT) loss to enhance global cross-modal consistency and mitigate modality gap issues. Extensive experiments on three Vietnamese benchmarks (UITOpenViIC, KTVIC, and Crossmodal-3600) demonstrate that ViCLIP-OT consistently outperforms CLIP and SigLIP baselines in both in-domain and zero-shot settings. On UIT-OpenViIC, the model achieves an average Recall@K of 67.34%, improving upon CLIP by 5.75 percentage points. In zero-shot evaluation on Crossmodal-3600, ViCLIPOT surpasses CLIP by 11.72 percentage points. Embedding-space analysis further confirms improved alignment and reduced modality gap. The results indicate that integrating SIGROT provides an effective and scalable strategy for cross-modal retrieval in low-resource languages, offering practical implications for intelligent multimedia retrieval systems in Vietnamese and other underrepresented linguistic contexts.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-powered smart glasses, one of the hottest wearable devices, has unlocked new frontiers for multimodal interaction, with Visual Question Answering (VQA) over external knowledge sources emerging as a core application. Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) adapted to smart glasses are typically trained and evaluated on traditional multimodal datasets; however, these datasets lack the variety and realism needed to reflect smart glasses usage scenarios and diverge from their specific challenges, where accurately identifying the object of interest must precede any external knowledge retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce SUPERGLASSES, the first comprehensive VQA benchmark built on real-world data entirely collected by smart glasses devices. SUPERGLASSES comprises 2,422 egocentric image-question pairs spanning 14 image domains and 8 query categories, enriched with full search trajectories and reasoning annotations. We evaluate 26 representative VLMs on this benchmark, revealing significant performance gaps. To address the limitations of existing models, we further propose SUPERLENS, a multimodal smart glasses agent that enables retrieval-augmented answer generation by integrating automatic object detection, query decoupling, and multimodal web search. Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT-4o by 2.19 percent, and highlights the need for task-specific solutions in smart glasses VQA scenarios.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity text-to-image generation, but their tendency to memorize training data raises critical privacy and intellectual property concerns. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that MoFit consistently outperforms prior VLM-conditioned baselines and achieves performance competitive with caption-dependent methods.

Abstract: Prior dual-stream methods with the feature interaction mechanism have achieved remarkable performance in single image reflection removal (SIRR). However, they often struggle with (1) semantic understanding gap between the features of pre-trained models and those of reflection removal models, and (2) reflection label inconsistencies between synthetic and real-world training data. In this work, we first adopt the parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy by integrating several learnable Mona layers into the pre-trained model to align the training directions. Then, a label generator is designed to unify the reflection labels for both synthetic and real-world data. In addition, a Gaussian-based Adaptive Frequency Learning Block (G-AFLB) is proposed to adaptively learn and fuse the frequency priors, and a Dynamic Agent Attention (DAA) is employed as an alternative to window-based attention by dynamically modeling the significance levels across windows (inter-) and within an individual window (intra-). These components constitute our proposed Gap-Free Reflection Removal Network (GFRRN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFRRN, achieving superior performance against state-of-the-art SIRR methods.

Abstract: Small target detection in UAV imagery faces significant challenges such as scale variations, dense distribution, and the dominance of small targets. Existing algorithms rely on manually designed components, and general-purpose detectors are not optimized for UAV images, making it difficult to balance accuracy and complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an end-to-end object detection framework, UFO-DETR, which integrates an LSKNet-based backbone network to optimize the receptive field and reduce the number of parameters. By combining the DAttention and AIFI modules, the model flexibly models multi-scale spatial relationships, improving multi-scale target detection performance. Additionally, the DynFreq-C3 module is proposed to enhance small target detection capability through cross-space frequency feature enhancement. Experimental results show that, compared to RT-DETR-L, the proposed method offers significant advantages in both detection performance and computational efficiency, providing an efficient solution for UAV edge computing.

Abstract: 3D Large Vision-Language Models (3D LVLMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various multimodal tasks. However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy to fuse feature information across different frequency domains. Experimental results on multiple 3D scene benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, while real-world deployment experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used for real-time, noninvasive diagnosis, but speckle and related artifacts reduce image quality and can hinder interpretation. We present a diffusion-based ultrasound despeckling method built on the Image Restoration Stochastic Differential Equations framework. To enable supervised training, we curate large paired datasets by simulating ultrasound images from speckle-free magnetic resonance images using the Matlab UltraSound Toolbox. The proposed model reconstructs speckle-suppressed images while preserving anatomically meaningful edges and contrast. On a held-out simulated test set, our approach consistently outperforms classical filters and recent learning-based despeckling baselines. We quantify prediction uncertainty via cross-model variance and show that higher uncertainty correlates with higher reconstruction error, providing a practical indicator of difficult or failure-prone regions. Finally, we evaluate sensitivity to simulation probe settings and observe domain shift, motivating diversified training and adaptation for robust clinical deployment.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly hinders their reliable deployment. Existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy: they often require expensive reference models and multiple forward passes, or apply static edits that risk suppressing genuine visual evidence. To address this, we introduce HulluEdit, a single-pass, reference-free intervention framework. Our core innovation is orthogonal subspace editing: we decompose the hidden states of the model into orthogonal subspaces - visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty - enabling selective suppression of hallucinatory patterns without interfering with visual grounding. This approach mathematically guarantees that edits applied to the prior subspace leave the visual component entirely unaffected. Extensive experiments show that HulluEdit achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks including POPE and CHAIR across diverse architectures, while preserving general capabilities on MME and maintaining efficient inference. Our method consistently outperforms contrastive decoding and static subspace editing baselines, offering a new pathway toward more trustworthy LVLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we study idiosyncrasies in the caption models and their downstream impact on text-to-image models. We design a systematic analysis: given either a generated caption or the corresponding image, we train neural networks to predict the originating caption model. Our results show that text classification yields very high accuracy (99.70\%), indicating that captioning models embed distinctive stylistic signatures. In contrast, these signatures largely disappear in the generated images, with classification accuracy dropping to at most 50\% even for the state-of-the-art Flux model. To better understand this cross-modal discrepancy, we further analyze the data and find that the generated images fail to preserve key variations present in captions, such as differences in the level of detail, emphasis on color and texture, and the distribution of objects within a scene. Overall, our classification-based framework provides a novel methodology for quantifying both the stylistic idiosyncrasies of caption models and the prompt-following ability of text-to-image systems.

Abstract: Generating human motion with precise spatial control is a challenging problem. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or slow optimization, and enforcing hard constraints frequently disrupts motion naturalness. Building on the observation that many animation tasks can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, we introduce ProjFlow, a training-free sampler that achieves zero-shot, exact satisfaction of linear spatial constraints while preserving motion realism. Our key advance is a novel kinematics-aware metric that encodes skeletal topology. This metric allows the sampler to enforce hard constraints by distributing corrections coherently across the entire skeleton, avoiding the unnatural artifacts of naive projection. Furthermore, for sparse inputs, such as filling in long gaps between a few keyframes, we introduce a time-varying formulation using pseudo-observations that fade during sampling. Extensive experiments on representative applications, motion inpainting, and 2D-to-3D lifting, demonstrate that ProjFlow achieves exact constraint satisfaction and matches or improves realism over zero-shot baselines, while remaining competitive with training-based controllers.

Abstract: Most text-to-video (T2V) generators prioritize aesthetic quality, but often ignoring the spatial constraints in the generated videos. In this work, we present SPATIALALIGN, a self-improvement framework that enhances T2V models capabilities to depict Dynamic Spatial Relationships (DSR) specified in text prompts. We present a zeroth-order regularized Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune T2V models towards better alignment with DSR. Specifically, we design DSR-SCORE, a geometry-based metric that quantitatively measures the alignment between generated videos and the specified DSRs in prompts, which is a step forward from prior works that rely on VLM for evaluation. We also conduct a dataset of text-video pairs with diverse DSRs to facilitate the study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned model significantly out performs the baseline in spatial relationships. The code will be released in Link.

Abstract: Recent advances in image authenticity have primarily focused on deepfake detection and localization, leaving recovery of tampered contents for factual retrieval relatively underexplored. We propose a unified hidden-code recovery framework that enables both retrieval and restoration from post-hoc and in-generation watermarking paradigms. Our method encodes semantic and perceptual information into a compact hidden-code representation, refined through multi-scale vector quantization, and enhances contextual reasoning via conditional Transformer modules. To enable systematic evaluation for natural images, we construct ImageNet-S, a benchmark that provides paired image-label factual retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-S demonstrate that our method exhibits promising retrieval and reconstruction performance while remaining fully compatible with diverse watermarking pipelines. This framework establishes a foundation for general-purpose image recovery beyond detection and localization.

Abstract: Tokenization in video models, typically through patchification, generates an excessive and redundant number of tokens. This severely limits video efficiency and scalability. While recent trajectory-based tokenizers offer a promising solution by decoupling video duration from token count, they rely on complex external segmentation and tracking pipelines that are slow and task-agnostic. We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2). It achieves the best accuracy at scale across both classification and retrieval benchmarks, while maintaining efficiency comparable to the best token-merging methods. TrajTok also proves to be a versatile component beyond its role as a tokenizer. We show that it can be seamlessly integrated as either a probing head for pretrained visual features (TrajAdapter) or an alignment connector in vision-language models (TrajVLM) with especially strong performance in long-video reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce SceneTransporter, an end-to-end framework for structured 3D scene generation from a single image. While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation. Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity. Code and models will be publicly available at https://2019epwl.github.io/SceneTransporter/.

Abstract: Human trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous navigation and video surveillance. While recent works have explored the integration of human skeleton sequences to complement trajectory information, skeleton data in real-world environments often suffer from missing joints caused by occlusions. These disturbances significantly degrade prediction accuracy, indicating the need for more robust skeleton representations. We propose a robust trajectory prediction method that incorporates a self-supervised skeleton representation model pretrained with masked autoencoding. Experimental results in occlusion-prone scenarios show that our method improves robustness to missing skeletal data without sacrificing prediction accuracy, and consistently outperforms baseline models in clean-to-moderate missingness regimes.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence causes significant image degradation due to pixel displacement (tilt) and blur, particularly in long-range imaging applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for atmospheric turbulence mitigation, GSTurb, which integrates optical flow-guided tilt correction and Gaussian splatting for modeling non-isoplanatic blur. The framework employs Gaussian parameters to represent tilt and blur, and optimizes them across multiple frames to enhance restoration. Experimental results on the ATSyn-static dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a peak PSNR of 27.67 dB and SSIM of 0.8735. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, GSTurb improves PSNR by 1.3 dB (a 4.5% increase) and SSIM by 0.048 (a 5.8% increase). Additionally, on real datasets, including the TSRWGAN Real-World and CLEAR datasets, GSTurb outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance. These results highlight that combining optical flow-guided tilt correction with Gaussian splatting effectively enhances image restoration under both synthetic and real-world turbulence conditions. The code for this method will be available at https://github.com/DuhlLiamz/3DGS_turbulence/tree/main.

Abstract: With the recent fast development of generative models, instruction-based image editing has shown great potential in generating high-quality images. However, the quality of editing highly depends on carefully designed instructions, placing the burden of task decomposition and sequencing entirely on the user. To achieve autonomous image editing, we present PhotoAgent, a system that advances image editing through explicit aesthetic planning. Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model. We also construct a test set containing 1,017 photos to systematically assess autonomous photo editing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhotoAgent consistently improves both instruction adherence and visual quality compared with baseline methods.

Abstract: Face aging, an ill-posed problem shaped by environmental and genetic factors, is vital in entertainment, forensics, and digital archiving, where realistic age transformations must preserve both identity and visual realism. However, existing works relying on numerical age representations overlook the interplay of biological and contextual cues. Despite progress in recent face aging models, they struggle with identity preservation in wide age transformations, also static attention and optimization-heavy inversion in diffusion limit adaptability, fine-grained control and background consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and in-the-wild testset demonstrate that FaceTT achieves superior identity retention, background preservation and aging realism over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Video polyp segmentation (VPS) is an important task in computer-aided colonoscopy, as it helps doctors accurately locate and track polyps during examinations. However, VPS remains challenging because polyps often look similar to surrounding mucosa, leading to weak semantic discrimination. In addition, large changes in polyp position and scale across video frames make stable and accurate segmentation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference. Extensive experiments on the SUN-SEG dataset demonstrate that CMSA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and real-time clinical applicability.

Abstract: Soil texture is a foundational attribute that governs water availability and erosion in agriculture, as well as load bearing capacity, deformation response, and shrink-swell risk in geotechnical engineering. Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical imaging are typically pretrained on increasingly large datasets, following a "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. However, this strategy faces two critical challenges: large-scale medical datasets often contain substantial redundancy and severe class imbalance that bias representation learning toward over-represented patterns, and indiscriminate training regardless of heterogeneity in data quality incurs considerable computational inefficiency. Here we demonstrate that active, principled data curation during pretraining can serve as a viable, cost-effective alternative to brute-force dataset enlargement. We introduce CheXficient, a chest X-ray (CXR) foundation model that selectively prioritizes informative training samples. CheXficient is pretrained on only 22.7% of 1,235,004 paired CXR images and reports while consuming under 27.3% of the total compute budget, yet achieving comparable or superior performance to its full-data counterpart and other large-scale pretrained models. We assess CheXficient across 20 individual benchmarks spanning 5 task types, including non-adapted off-the-shelf evaluations (zero-shot findings classification and crossmodal retrieval) and adapted downstream tasks (disease prediction, semantic segmentation, and radiology report generation). Further analyses show that CheXficient systematically prioritizes under-represented training samples, improving generalizability on long-tailed or rare conditions. Overall, our work offers practical insights into the data and computation demands for efficient pretraining and downstream adaptation of medical vision-language foundation models.

Abstract: As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) scale up and reinforcement learning (RL) methods mature, LMMs have made notable progress in complex reasoning and decision making. Yet training still relies on static data and fixed recipes, making it difficult to diagnose capability blind spots or provide dynamic, targeted reinforcement. Motivated by findings that test driven error exposure and feedback based correction outperform repetitive practice, we propose Diagnostic-driven Progressive Evolution (DPE), a spiral loop where diagnosis steers data generation and reinforcement, and each iteration re-diagnoses the updated model to drive the next round of targeted improvement. DPE has two key components. First, multiple agents annotate and quality control massive unlabeled multimodal data, using tools such as web search and image editing to produce diverse, realistic samples. Second, DPE attributes failures to specific weaknesses, dynamically adjusts the data mixture, and guides agents to generate weakness focused data for targeted reinforcement. Experiments on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct show stable, continual gains across eleven benchmarks, indicating DPE as a scalable paradigm for continual LMM training under open task distributions. Our code, models, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/hongruijia/DPE.

Abstract: Panoramic semantic segmentation models are typically trained under a strict gravity-aligned assumption. However, real-world captures often deviate from this canonical orientation due to unconstrained camera motions, such as the rotational jitter of handheld devices or the dynamic attitude shifts of aerial platforms. This discrepancy causes standard spherical Transformers to overfit global latitude cues, leading to performance collapse under 3D reorientations. To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes. We further use index-based spherical resampling together with a logit-level SO(3)-consistency regularizer during training. To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\pm 35^\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU. In contrast, SO3UFormer demonstrates remarkable stability, achieving 72.03 mIoU on Pose35 and retaining 70.67 mIoU under full SO(3) rotations.

Abstract: A clinically actionable Cardiac Digital Twin (CDT) should reconstruct individualised cardiac anatomy and physiology, update its internal state from multimodal signals, and enable a broad range of downstream simulations beyond isolated tasks. However, existing CDT frameworks remain limited to task-specific predictors rather than building a patient-specific, manipulable virtual heart. In this work, we introduce Chain of Flow (COF), a foundational ECG-driven generative framework that reconstructs full 4D cardiac structure and motion from a single cardiac cycle. The method integrates cine-CMR and 12-lead ECG during training to learn a unified representation of cardiac geometry, electrophysiology, and motion dynamics. We evaluate Chain of Flow on diverse cohorts and demonstrate accurate recovery of cardiac anatomy, chamber-wise function, and dynamic motion patterns. The reconstructed 4D hearts further support downstream CDT tasks such as volumetry, regional function analysis, and virtual cine synthesis. By enabling full 4D organ reconstruction directly from ECG, COF transforms cardiac digital twins from narrow predictive models into fully generative, patient-specific virtual hearts. Code will be released after review.

Abstract: Although deep learning has significantly advanced the perception capabilities of intelligent transportation systems, railway applications continue to suffer from a scarcity of high-quality, annotated data for safety-critical tasks like obstacle detection. While photorealistic simulators offer a solution, they often struggle with the ``sim-to-real" gap; conversely, simple image-masking techniques lack the spatio-temporal coherence required to obtain augmented single- and multi-frame scenes with the correct appearance and dimensions. This paper introduces a multi-modal augmented reality framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating photorealistic virtual objects into real-world railway sequences from the OSDaR23 dataset. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5 features, our pipeline leverages LiDAR point-clouds and INS/GNSS data to ensure accurate object placement and temporal stability across RGB frames. This paper also proposes a segmentation-based refinement strategy for INS/GNSS data to significantly improve the realism of the augmented sequences, as confirmed by the comparative study presented in the paper. Carefully designed augmented sequences are collected to produce OSDaR-AR, a public dataset designed to support the development of next-generation railway perception systems. The dataset is available at the following page: https://syndra.retis.santannapisa.it/osdarar.html

Abstract: While autonomous navigation has achieved remarkable success in passive perception (e.g., object detection and segmentation), it remains fundamentally constrained by a void in knowledge-driven, interactive environmental cognition. In the high-stakes domain of maritime navigation, the ability to bridge the gap between raw visual perception and complex cognitive reasoning is not merely an enhancement but a critical prerequisite for Autonomous Surface Vessels to execute safe and precise maneuvers. To this end, we present WaterVideoQA, the first large-scale, comprehensive Video Question Answering benchmark specifically engineered for all-waterway environments. This benchmark encompasses 3,029 video clips across six distinct waterway categories, integrating multifaceted variables such as volatile lighting and dynamic weather to rigorously stress-test ASV capabilities across a five-tier hierarchical cognitive framework. Furthermore, we introduce NaviMind, a pioneering multi-agent neuro-symbolic system designed for open-ended maritime reasoning. By synergizing Adaptive Semantic Routing, Situation-Aware Hierarchical Reasoning, and Autonomous Self-Reflective Verification, NaviMind transitions ASVs from superficial pattern matching to regulation-compliant, interpretable decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly transcends existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent, trustworthy interaction in dynamic maritime environments.

Abstract: Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this paper, we present MLLM-Sampler Joint Evolution (MSJoE), a novel framework that jointly evolves the MLLM and a lightweight key-frame sampler for efficient long-form video understanding. MSJoE builds upon a key assumption that only a small subset of key-frames is truly informative for answering each question to a video. Specifically, MSJoE first reasons out several queries, which describe diverse visual perspectives relevant to the question. Then, these queries interact with a frozen CLIP model to produce a query-frame similarity matrix. Finally, a lightweight sampler predicts key-frame sampling weights from this matrix, selecting a compact set of informative frames, which are then fed into the MLLM for answer generation. Both the MLLM and sampler are jointly optimized through reinforcement learning, enabling co-adaptation of query-reasoning, frame-sampling, and key-frame understanding. A new long-video QA dataset containing 2.8K videos with 7K question-answer pairs is collected to support the training process. Extensive experiments on VideoMME, LongVideoBench, LVBench, and MLVU show that MSJoE achieves 8.0\% accuracy gain upon the base MLLM, and 1.1\% higher accuracy than strongest baseline method.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has demonstrated promising results across various visual adaptation tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate that our pMoE not only achieves superior performance with a large margin of improvements but also offers an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptation effectiveness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Pacing strategies, defined by velocity and stroke rate profiles, are essential for peak performance in canoe sprint. While GPS is the gold standard for analysis, its limited availability necessitates automated video-based solutions. This paper presents an extended framework for reconstructing performance metrics from panned and zoomed video recordings across all sprint disciplines (K1-K4, C1-C2) and distances (200m-500m). Our method utilizes YOLOv8 for buoy and athlete detection, leveraging the known buoy grid to estimate homographies. We generalized the estimation of the boat position by means of learning a boat-specific athlete offset using a U-net based boat tip calibration. Further, we implement a robust tracking scheme using optical flow to adapt to multi-athlete boat types. Finally, we introduce methods to extract stroke rate information from either pose estimations or the athlete bounding boxes themselves. Evaluation against GPS data from elite competitions yields a velocity RRMSE of 0.020 +- 0.011 (rho = 0.956) and a stroke rate RRMSE of 0.022 +- 0.024 (rho = 0.932). The methods provide coaches with highly accurate, automated feedback without requiring on-boat sensors or manual annotation.

Abstract: This project provides a comparative study of dynamic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for various tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and time series analysis. Based on the ResNet-18 architecture, we compare five variants of CNNs: the vanilla CNN, the hard attention-based CNN, the soft attention-based CNN with local (pixel-wise) and global (image-wise) feature attention, and the omni-directional CNN (ODConv). Experiments on Tiny ImageNet, Pascal VOC, and the UCR Time Series Classification Archive illustrate that attention mechanisms and dynamic convolution methods consistently exceed conventional CNNs in accuracy, efficiency, and computational performance. ODConv was especially effective on morphologically complex images by being able to dynamically adjust to varying spatial patterns. Dynamic CNNs enhanced feature representation and cross-task generalization through adaptive kernel modulation. This project provides perspectives on advanced CNN design architecture for multiplexed data modalities and indicates promising directions in neural network engineering.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive(VAR) models enhance generation quality but face a critical efficiency bottleneck in later stages. In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework for VAR models that fundamentally differs from prior approaches such as FastVAR and SkipVAR. Instead of relying on heuristic skipping strategies, our method leverages attention entropy to characterize the semantic projections across different dimensions of the model architecture. This enables precise identification of parameter dynamics under varying token granularity levels, semantic scopes, and generation scales. Building on this analysis, we further uncover sparsity patterns along three critical dimensions-token, layer, and scale-and propose a set of fine-grained optimization strategies tailored to these patterns. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves aggressive acceleration of the generation process while significantly preserving semantic fidelity and fine details, outperforming traditional methods in both efficiency and quality. Experiments on Infinity-2B and Infinity-8B models demonstrate that ToProVAR achieves up to 3.4x acceleration with minimal quality loss, effectively mitigating the issues found in prior work. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fingerspelling is a component of sign languages in which words are spelled out letter by letter using specific hand poses. Automatic fingerspelling recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities, yet it remains challenging due to the signing-hand ambiguity issue, the lack of appropriate training losses, and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis. We propose a multi-hand-capable fingerspelling recognizer that supports both single- and multi-hand inputs and performs implicit signing-hand detection by incorporating a dual-level positional encoding and a signing-hand focus (SF) loss. The SF loss encourages cross-attention to focus on the signing hand, enabling implicit signing-hand detection during recognition. Furthermore, without relying on the CTC loss, we introduce a monotonic alignment (MA) loss that enforces the output letter sequence to follow the temporal order of the input pose sequence through cross-attention regularization. In addition, we propose a frame-wise letter-conditioned generator that synthesizes realistic fingerspelling pose sequences for OOV words. This generator enables the construction of a new synthetic benchmark, called FSNeo. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in recognition and validate the effectiveness of the proposed recognizer and generator.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis requires models to not only detect lesions but also generate clinically interpretable reasoning grounded in imaging manifestations, yet existing public datasets remain limited in annotation richness and diagnostic semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark in advancing clinically grounded multimodal diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to increasing interest in agent-based systems. While most prior work in medical imaging concentrates on automating routine clinical workflows, we study an underexplored yet clinically significant setting: distinguishing visually hard-to-separate diseases in a zero-shot setting. We benchmark representative agents on two imaging-only proxy diagnostic tasks, (1) melanoma vs. atypical nevus and (2) pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia, where visual features are highly confounded despite substantial differences in clinical management. We introduce a multi-agent framework based on contrastive adjudication. Experimental results show improved diagnostic performance (an 11-percentage-point gain in accuracy on dermoscopy data) and reduced unsupported claims on qualitative samples, although overall performance remains insufficient for clinical deployment. We acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in human annotations and the absence of clinical context, which further limit the translation to real-world settings. Within this controlled setting, this pilot study provides preliminary insights into zero-shot agent performance in visually confounded scenarios.

Abstract: World models based on video generation demonstrate remarkable potential for simulating interactive environments but face persistent difficulties in two key areas: maintaining long-term content consistency when scenes are revisited and enabling precise camera control from user-provided inputs. Existing methods based on explicit 3D reconstruction often compromise flexibility in unbounded scenarios and fine-grained structures. Alternative methods rely directly on previously generated frames without establishing explicit spatial correspondence, thereby constraining controllability and consistency. To address these limitations, we present UCM, a novel framework that unifies long-term memory and precise camera control via a time-aware positional encoding warping mechanism. To reduce computational overhead, we design an efficient dual-stream diffusion transformer for high-fidelity generation. Moreover, we introduce a scalable data curation strategy utilizing point-cloud-based rendering to simulate scene revisiting, facilitating training on over 500K monocular videos. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that UCM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-term scene consistency, while also achieving precise camera controllability in high-fidelity video generation.

Abstract: Detecting visual anomalies in industrial inspection often requires training with only a few normal images per category. Recent few-shot methods achieve strong results employing foundation-model features, but typically rely on memory banks, auxiliary datasets, or multi-modal tuning of vision-language models. We therefore question whether such complexity is necessary given the feature representations of vision foundation models. To answer this question, we introduce SubspaceAD, a training-free method, that operates in two simple stages. First, patch-level features are extracted from a small set of normal images by a frozen DINOv2 backbone. Second, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model is fit to these features to estimate the low-dimensional subspace of normal variations. At inference, anomalies are detected via the reconstruction residual with respect to this subspace, producing interpretable and statistically grounded anomaly scores. Despite its simplicity, SubspaceAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across one-shot and few-shot settings without training, prompt tuning, or memory banks. In the one-shot anomaly detection setting, SubspaceAD achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC of 98.0% and 97.6% on the MVTec-AD dataset, and 93.3% and 98.3% on the VisA dataset, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Image alignment is a fundamental task in computer vision with broad applications. Existing methods predominantly employ optical flow-based image warping. However, this technique is susceptible to common challenges such as occlusions and illumination variations, leading to degraded alignment visual quality and compromised accuracy in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present DMAligner, a diffusion-based framework for image alignment through alignment-oriented view synthesis. DMAligner is crafted to tackle the challenges in image alignment from a new perspective, employing a generation-based solution that showcases strong capabilities and avoids the problems associated with flow-based image warping. Specifically, we propose a Dynamics-aware Diffusion Training approach for learning conditional image generation, synthesizing a novel view for image alignment. This incorporates a Dynamics-aware Mask Producing (DMP) module to adaptively distinguish dynamic foreground regions from static backgrounds, enabling the diffusion model to more effectively handle challenges that classical methods struggle to solve. Furthermore, we develop the Dynamic Scene Image Alignment (DSIA) dataset using Blender, which includes 1,033 indoor and outdoor scenes with over 30K image pairs tailored for image alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on DSIA benchmarks, as well as on a series of widely-used video datasets for qualitative comparisons.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a multimodal query (comprising a reference image and a modification text), without training on annotated triplets. Existing methods typically convert the multimodal query into a single modality-either as an edited caption for Text-to-Image retrieval (T2I) or as an edited image for Image-to-Image retrieval (I2I). However, each paradigm has inherent limitations: T2I often loses fine-grained visual details, while I2I struggles with complex semantic modifications. To effectively leverage their complementary strengths under diverse query intents, we propose WISER, a training-free framework that unifies T2I and I2I via a "retrieve-verify-refine" pipeline, explicitly modeling intent awareness and uncertainty awareness. Specifically, WISER first performs Wider Search by generating both edited captions and images for parallel retrieval to broaden the candidate pool. Then, it conducts Adaptive Fusion with a verifier to assess retrieval confidence, triggering refinement for uncertain retrievals, and dynamically fusing the dual-path for reliable ones. For uncertain retrievals, WISER generates refinement suggestions through structured self-reflection to guide the next retrieval round toward Deeper Thinking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISER significantly outperforms previous methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving relative improvements of 45% on CIRCO (mAP@5) and 57% on CIRR (Recall@1) over existing training-free methods. Notably, it even surpasses many training-dependent methods, highlighting its superiority and generalization under diverse scenarios. Code will be released at https://github.com/Physicsmile/WISER.

Abstract: Detecting objects in aerial images confronts some significant challenges, including small size, dense and non-uniform distribution of objects over high-resolution images, which makes detection inefficient. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a small object detection algorithm based on a Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention and Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement in aerial images. Firstly, in order to improve the feature representation of ResNet-50 on small objects, we presented a novel Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention (SLPA) module, which is integrated after each stage of ResNet-50 to identify and emphasize important local regions. Secondly, to enhance the model's semantic understanding and features representation, we designed a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MSFEM), which is incorporated into the lateral connections of C5 layer for building Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Finally, the features representation quality of traditional feature pyramid network will be affected because the features are not aligned when the upper and lower layers are fused. In order to handle it, we utilized deformable convolutions to align the features in the fusion processing of the upper and lower levels of the Feature Pyramid Network, which can help enhance the model's ability to detect and recognize small objects. The extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets: VisDrone and DOTA demonstrate that our improved model performs better for small object detection in aerial images compared to the original algorithm.

Abstract: Volumetric videos offer immersive 4D experiences, but remain difficult to reconstruct, store, and stream at scale. Existing Gaussian Splatting based methods achieve high-quality reconstruction but break down on long sequences, temporal inconsistency, and fail under large motions and disocclusions. Moreover, their outputs are typically incompatible with conventional video coding pipelines, preventing practical applications.
  We introduce PackUV, a novel 4D Gaussian representation that maps all Gaussian attributes into a sequence of structured, multi-scale UV atlas, enabling compact, image-native storage. To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions. The resulting UV atlas format is the first unified volumetric video representation compatible with standard video codecs (e.g., FFV1) without losing quality, enabling efficient streaming within existing multimedia infrastructure.
  To evaluate long-duration volumetric capture, we present PackUV-2B, the largest multi-view video dataset to date, featuring more than 50 synchronized cameras, substantial motion, and frequent disocclusions across 100 sequences and 2B (billion) frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in rendering fidelity while scaling to sequences up to 30 minutes with consistent quality.

Abstract: Energy-based predictive world models provide a powerful approach for multi-step visual planning by reasoning over latent energy landscapes rather than generating pixels. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (i) their latent representations are typically learned in Euclidean space, neglecting the underlying geometric and hierarchical structure among states, and (ii) they struggle with long-horizon prediction, which leads to rapid degradation across extended rollouts. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

Abstract: Point cloud video understanding is critical for robotics as it accurately encodes motion and scene interaction. We recognize that 4D datasets are far scarcer than 3D ones, which hampers the scalability of self-supervised 4D models. A promising alternative is to transfer 3D pre-trained models to 4D perception tasks. However, rigorous empirical analysis reveals two critical limitations that impede transfer capability: overfitting and the modality gap. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel "Align then Adapt" (PointATA) paradigm that decomposes parameter-efficient transfer learning into two sequential stages. Optimal-transport theory is employed to quantify the distributional discrepancy between 3D and 4D datasets, enabling our proposed point align embedder to be trained in Stage 1 to alleviate the underlying modality gap. To mitigate overfitting, an efficient point-video adapter and a spatial-context encoder are integrated into the frozen 3D backbone to enhance temporal modeling capacity in Stage 2. Notably, with the above engineering-oriented designs, PointATA enables a pre-trained 3D model without temporal knowledge to reason about dynamic video content at a smaller parameter cost compared to previous work. Extensive experiments show that PointATA can match or even outperform strong full fine-tuning models, whilst enjoying the advantage of parameter efficiency, e.g. 97.21 \% accuracy on 3D action recognition, $+8.7 \%$ on 4 D action segmentation, and 84.06\% on 4D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Foundation models increasingly offer potential to support interactive, agentic workflows that assist researchers during analysis and interpretation of image data. Such workflows often require coupling vision to language to provide a natural-language interface. However, paired image-text data needed to learn this coupling are scarce and difficult to obtain in many research and clinical settings. One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas. It matches the cytoarchitectonic reference label for in-scope patches with 90.6% accuracy and, with the area label masked, its descriptions remain discriminative enough to recover the area in an 8-way test with 68.6% accuracy. These results suggest that weak, label-mediated pairing can suffice to connect existing biomedical vision foundation models to language, providing a practical recipe for integrating natural-language in domains where fine-grained paired annotations are scarce.

Abstract: Event cameras record luminance changes with microsecond resolution, but converting their sparse, asynchronous output into dense tensors that neural networks can exploit remains a core challenge. Conventional histograms or globally-decayed time-surface representations apply fixed temporal parameters across the entire image plane, which in practice creates a trade-off between preserving spatial structure during still periods and retaining sharp edges during rapid motion. We introduce Locally Adaptive Decay Surfaces (LADS), a family of event representations in which the temporal decay at each location is modulated according to local signal dynamics. Three strategies are explored, based on event rate, Laplacian-of-Gaussian response, and high-frequency spectral energy. These adaptive schemes preserve detail in quiescent regions while reducing blur in regions of dense activity. Extensive experiments on the public data show that LADS consistently improves both face detection and facial landmark accuracy compared to standard non-adaptive representations. At 30 Hz, LADS achieves higher detection accuracy and lower landmark error than either baseline, and at 240 Hz it mitigates the accuracy decline typically observed at higher frequencies, sustaining 2.44 % normalized mean error for landmarks and 0.966 mAP50 in face detection. These high-frequency results even surpass the accuracy reported in prior works operating at 30 Hz, setting new benchmarks for event-based face analysis. Moreover, by preserving spatial structure at the representation stage, LADS supports the use of much lighter network architectures while still retaining real-time performance. These results highlight the importance of context-aware temporal integration for neuromorphic vision and point toward real-time, high-frequency human-computer interaction systems that exploit the unique advantages of event cameras.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation requires effective modeling of both global anatomical structures and fine-grained boundary details. Recent state space models (e.g., Vision Mamba) offer efficient long-range dependency modeling. However, their one-dimensional serialization weakens local spatial continuity and high-frequency representation. To this end, we propose SpectralMamba-UNet, a novel frequency-disentangled framework to decouple the learning of structural and textural information in the spectral domain. Our Spectral Decomposition and Modeling (SDM) module applies discrete cosine transform to decompose low- and high-frequency features, where low frequency contributes to global contextual modeling via a frequency-domain Mamba and high frequency preserves boundary-sensitive details. To balance spectral contributions, we introduce a Spectral Channel Reweighting (SCR) mechanism to form channel-wise frequency-aware attention, and a Spectral-Guided Fusion (SGF) module to achieve adaptively multi-scale fusion in the decoder. Experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse modalities and segmentation targets, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Abstract: Estimating camera motion from monocular video is a fundamental problem in computer vision, central to tasks such as SLAM, visual odometry, and structure-from-motion. Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency. Additionally, experiments on SLAM show that the proposed method reduces RMSE by correcting the heading during camera pose initialization.

Abstract: Adversarial transferability refers to the capacity of adversarial examples generated on the surrogate model to deceive alternate, unexposed victim models. This property eliminates the need for direct access to the victim model during an attack, thereby raising considerable security concerns in practical applications and attracting substantial research attention recently. In this work, we discern a lack of a standardized framework and criteria for evaluating transfer-based attacks, leading to potentially biased assessments of existing approaches. To rectify this gap, we have conducted an exhaustive review of hundreds of related works, organizing various transfer-based attacks into six distinct categories. Subsequently, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to serve as a benchmark for evaluating these attacks. In addition, we delineate common strategies that enhance adversarial transferability and highlight prevalent issues that could lead to unfair comparisons. Finally, we provide a brief review of transfer-based attacks beyond image classification.

Abstract: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize target objects in images using only image-level labels. Despite recent progress, many approaches still rely on multi-stage pipelines or full fine-tuning of large backbones, which increases training cost, while the broader WSOL community continues to face the challenge of partial object coverage. We present TriLite, a single-stage WSOL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer with Dinov2 pre-training in a self-supervised manner, and introduces only a minimal number of trainable parameters (fewer than 800K on ImageNet-1K) for both classification and localization. At its core is the proposed TriHead module, which decomposes patch features into foreground, background, and ambiguous regions, thereby improving object coverage while suppressing spurious activations. By disentangling classification and localization objectives, TriLite effectively exploits the universal representations learned by self-supervised ViTs without requiring expensive end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and OpenImages demonstrate that TriLite sets a new state of the art, while remaining significantly more parameter-efficient and easier to train than prior methods. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for robust person Re-ID in unconstrained environments, learning from datasets with noisy labels and sparse per-identity samples remains a critical challenge. Existing noise-robust person Re-ID methods primarily rely on loss-correction or sample-selection strategies using softmax outputs. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations: 1) Softmax exhibits translation invariance, leading to over-confident and unreliable predictions on corrupted labels. 2) Conventional sample selection based on small-loss criteria often discards valuable hard positives that are crucial for learning discriminative features. To overcome these issues, we propose the CAlibration-to-REfinement (CARE) method, a two-stage framework that seeks certainty through probabilistic evidence propagation from calibration to refinement. In the calibration stage, we propose the probabilistic evidence calibration (PEC) that dismantles softmax translation invariance by injecting adaptive learnable parameters into the similarity function, and employs an evidential calibration loss to mitigate overconfidence on mislabeled samples. In the refinement stage, we design the evidence propagation refinement (EPR) that can more accurately distinguish between clean and noisy samples. Specifically, the EPR contains two steps: Firstly, the composite angular margin (CAM) metric is proposed to precisely distinguish clean but hard-to-learn positive samples from mislabeled ones in a hyperspherical space; Secondly, the certainty-oriented sphere weighting (COSW) is developed to dynamically allocate the importance of samples according to CAM, ensuring clean instances drive model updates. Extensive experimental results on Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK03 datasets under both random and patterned noises show that CARE achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: We propose a new unsupervised framework for online video stabilization. Unlike methods based on deep learning that require paired stable and unstable datasets, our approach instantiates the classical stabilization pipeline with three stages and incorporates a multithreaded buffering mechanism. This design addresses three longstanding challenges in end-to-end learning: limited data, poor controllability, and inefficiency on hardware with constrained resources. Existing benchmarks focus mainly on handheld videos with a forward view in visible light, which restricts the applicability of stabilization to domains such as UAV nighttime remote sensing. To fill this gap, we introduce a new multimodal UAV aerial video dataset (UAV-Test). Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online stabilizers in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while achieving performance comparable to offline methods.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that process 3D data typically rely on heavy, pre-trained visual encoders to extract geometric features. While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters. Project website: https://tev-fbk.github.io/Fase3D.

Abstract: Generating realistic conversational gestures are essential for achieving natural, socially engaging interactions with digital humans. However, existing methods typically map a single audio stream to a single speaker's motion, without considering social context or modeling the mutual dynamics between two people engaging in conversation. We present DyaDiT, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that generates contextually appropriate human motion from dyadic audio signals. Trained on Seamless Interaction Dataset, DyaDiT takes dyadic audio with optional social-context tokens to produce context-appropriate motion. It fuses information from both speakers to capture interaction dynamics, uses a motion dictionary to encode motion priors, and can optionally utilize the conversational partner's gestures to produce more responsive motion. We evaluate DyaDiT on standard motion generation metrics and conduct quantitative user studies, demonstrating that it not only surpasses existing methods on objective metrics but is also strongly preferred by users, highlighting its robustness and socially favorable motion generation. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal agents solve multi-step workflows grounded in visual evidence. For example, an agent can troubleshoot a device by linking a wiring photo to a schematic and validating the fix with online documentation, or plan a trip by interpreting a transit map and checking schedules under routing constraints. However, existing multimodal benchmarks mainly evaluate single-turn visual reasoning or specific tool skills, and they do not fully capture the realism, visual subtlety, and long-horizon tool use that practical agents require. We introduce AgentVista, a benchmark for generalist multimodal agents that spans 25 sub-domains across 7 categories, pairing realistic and detail-rich visual scenarios with natural hybrid tool use. Tasks require long-horizon tool interactions across modalities, including web search, image search, page navigation, and code-based operations for both image processing and general programming. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models exposes significant gaps in their ability to carry out long-horizon multimodal tool use. Even the best model in our evaluation, Gemini-3-Pro with tools, achieves only 27.3% overall accuracy, and hard instances can require more than 25 tool-calling turns. We expect AgentVista to accelerate the development of more capable and reliable multimodal agents for realistic and ultra-challenging problem solving.

Abstract: Despite substantial advances in all-in-one image restoration for addressing diverse degradations within a unified model, existing methods remain vulnerable to out-of-distribution degradations, thereby limiting their generalization in real-world scenarios. To tackle the challenge, this work is motivated by the intuition that multisource degraded feature distributions are induced by different degradation-specific shifts from an underlying degradation-agnostic distribution, and recovering such a shared distribution is thus crucial for achieving generalization across degradations. With this insight, we propose BaryIR, a representation learning framework that aligns multisource degraded features in the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) space, which models a degradation-agnostic distribution by minimizing the average of Wasserstein distances to multisource degraded distributions. We further introduce residual subspaces, whose embeddings are mutually contrasted while remaining orthogonal to the WB embeddings. Consequently, BaryIR explicitly decouples two orthogonal spaces: a WB space that encodes the degradation-agnostic invariant contents shared across degradations, and residual subspaces that adaptively preserve the degradation-specific knowledge. This disentanglement mitigates overfitting to in-distribution degradations and enables adaptive restoration grounded on the degradation-agnostic shared invariance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR performs competitively against state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Notably, BaryIR generalizes well to unseen degradations (\textit{e.g.,} types and levels) and shows remarkable robustness in learning generalized features, even when trained on limited degradation types and evaluated on real-world data with mixed degradations.

Abstract: Capturing 4D spatiotemporal surroundings is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of robots in dynamic environments. However, most existing methods address only one side of the problem: they either provide coarse geometric tracking via bounding boxes, or detailed 3D structures like voxel-based occupancy that lack explicit temporal association. In this work, we present Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking (LaGS) that advances spatiotemporal scene understanding in a holistic direction. Our approach incorporates camera-based end-to-end tracking with mask-based multi-view panoptic occupancy prediction, and addresses the key challenge of efficiently aggregating multi-view information into 3D voxel grids via a novel latent Gaussian splatting approach. Specifically, we first fuse observations into 3D Gaussians that serve as a sparse point-centric latent representation of the 3D scene, and then splat the aggregated features onto a 3D voxel grid that is decoded by a mask-based segmentation head. We evaluate LaGS on the Occ3D nuScenes and Waymo datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance for 4D panoptic occupancy tracking. We make our code available at https://lags.cs.uni-freiburg.de/.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time crowd counting on railway platforms is essential for safety and capacity management. We propose to use a single camera mounted in a train, scanning the platform while arriving. While hardware constraints are simple, counting remains challenging due to dense occlusions, camera motion, and perspective distortions during train arrivals. Most existing tracking-by-detection approaches assume static cameras or ignore physical consistency in motion modeling, leading to unreliable counting under dynamic conditions. We propose a physics-constrained tracking framework that unifies detection, appearance, and 3D motion reasoning in a real-time pipeline. Our approach integrates a transfer-learned YOLOv11m detector with EfficientNet-B0 appearance encoding within DeepSORT, while introducing a physics-constrained Kalman model (Phys-3D) that enforces physically plausible 3D motion dynamics through pinhole geometry. To address counting brittleness under occlusions, we implement a virtual counting band with persistence. On our platform benchmark, MOT-RailwayPlatformCrowdHead Dataset(MOT-RPCH), our method reduces counting error to 2.97%, demonstrating robust performance despite motion and occlusions. Our results show that incorporating first-principles geometry and motion priors enables reliable crowd counting in safety-critical transportation scenarios, facilitating effective train scheduling and platform safety management.

Abstract: We propose Uni-Animator, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework for unified image and video sketch colorization. Existing sketch colorization methods struggle to unify image and video tasks, suffering from imprecise color transfer with single or multiple references, inadequate preservation of high-frequency physical details, and compromised temporal coherence with motion artifacts in large-motion scenes. To tackle imprecise color transfer, we introduce visual reference enhancement via instance patch embedding, enabling precise alignment and fusion of reference color information. To resolve insufficient physical detail preservation, we design physical detail reinforcement using physical features that effectively capture and retain high-frequency textures. To mitigate motion-induced temporal inconsistency, we propose sketch-based dynamic RoPE encoding that adaptively models motion-aware spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Uni-Animator achieves competitive performance on both image and video sketch colorization, matching that of task-specific methods while unlocking unified cross-domain capabilities with high detail fidelity and robust temporal consistency.

Abstract: Compressing neural networks by quantizing model parameters offers useful trade-off between performance and efficiency. Methods like quantization-aware training and post-training quantization strive to maintain the downstream performance of compressed models compared to the full precision models. However, these techniques do not explicitly consider the impact on algorithmic fairness. In this work, we study fairness-aware mixed-precision quantization schemes for medical image classification under explicit bit budgets. We introduce FairQuant, a framework that combines group-aware importance analysis, budgeted mixed-precision allocation, and a learnable Bit-Aware Quantization (BAQ) mode that jointly optimizes weights and per-unit bit allocations under bitrate and fairness regularization. We evaluate the method on Fitzpatrick17k and ISIC2019 across ResNet18/50, DeiT-Tiny, and TinyViT. Results show that FairQuant configurations with average precision near 4-6 bits recover much of the Uniform 8-bit accuracy while improving worst-group performance relative to Uniform 4- and 8-bit baselines, with comparable fairness metrics under shared budgets.

Abstract: Colonoscopy video generation delivers dynamic, information-rich data critical for diagnosing intestinal diseases, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. High-quality video generation demands temporal consistency and precise control over clinical attributes, but faces challenges from irregular intestinal structures, diverse disease representations, and various imaging modalities. To this end, we propose ColoDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates dynamic-consistent and content-aware colonoscopy videos, aiming to alleviate data shortage and assist clinical analysis. At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation. Extensive experiments show ColoDiff generates videos with smooth transitions and rich dynamics. ColoDiff presents an effort in controllable colonoscopy video generation, revealing the potential of synthetic videos in complementing authentic representation and mitigating data scarcity in clinical settings.

Abstract: Human behaviors in the real world naturally encode rich, long-term contextual information that can be leveraged to train embodied agents for perception, understanding, and acting. However, existing capture systems typically rely on costly studio setups and wearable devices, limiting the large-scale collection of scene-conditioned human motion data in the wild. To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly. Compared with optical capture ground truth, we demonstrate that the dual-view setting exhibits a remarkable ability to mitigate depth ambiguity, achieving superior alignment and reconstruction performance over single iphone or monocular models. Based on the collected data, we empower three embodied AI tasks: monocular human-scene-reconstruction, where we fine-tune on feedforward models that output metric-scale, world-space aligned humans and scenes; physics-based character animation, where we prove our data could be used to scale human-object interaction skills and scene-aware motion tracking; and robot motion control, where we train a humanoid robot via sim-to-real RL to replicate human motions depicted in videos. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pipeline and its contributions towards advancing embodied AI research.

Abstract: Vision disorders significantly impact millions of lives, altering how visual information is processed and perceived.

Leveraging a combination of human and non-human datasets, models trained under normal and disorder-specific conditions revealed critical disruptions in feature maps, particularly for cataract and glaucoma, which align with known neural processing challenges in these conditions. Evaluation metrics such as activation energy and cosine similarity quantified the severity of these distortions, providing insights into the interplay between degraded visual inputs and learned representations.

Abstract: Plug-and-Play diffusion prior (PnPDP) frameworks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving imaging inverse problems by treating pretrained generative models as modular priors. However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence.

Abstract: This paper introduces Multidimensional Task Learning (MTL), a unified mathematical framework based on Generalized Einstein MLPs (GE-MLPs) that operate directly on tensors via the Einstein product. We argue that current computer vision task formulations are inherently constrained by matrix-based thinking: standard architectures rely on matrix-valued weights and vectorvalued biases, requiring structural flattening that restricts the space of naturally expressible tasks. GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches. This work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing computer vision tasks through the lens of tensor algebra.

Abstract: We present UniScale, a unified, scale-aware multi-view 3D reconstruction framework for robotic applications that flexibly integrates geometric priors through a modular, semantically informed design. In vision-based robotic navigation, the accurate extraction of environmental structure from raw image sequences is critical for downstream tasks. UniScale addresses this challenge with a single feed-forward network that jointly estimates camera intrinsics and extrinsics, scale-invariant depth and point maps, and the metric scale of a scene from multi-view images, while optionally incorporating auxiliary geometric priors when available. By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene. In robotic settings where camera intrinsics are known, they can be easily incorporated to improve performance, with additional gains obtained when camera poses are also available. This co-design enables robust, metric-aware 3D reconstruction within a single unified model. Importantly, UniScale does not require training from scratch, and leverages world priors exhibited in pre-existing models without geometric encoding strategies, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained robotic teams. We evaluate UniScale on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and consistent performance across diverse environments. We will release our implementation upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of digital entertainment, automated video summarization has become indispensable for applications such as content indexing, personalized recommendation, and efficient media archiving. Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While proficient at single-image captioning, these general-purpose models often exhibit critical failures in long-duration contexts, primarily a lack of ID-consistent character identification and a fractured narrative coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external "tool" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines.

Abstract: Which multimodal model should we use for classification? Previous studies suggest that the answer lies in CLIP-like contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), due to their remarkable performance in zero-shot classification. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are more suitable for complex tasks. In this work, we argue that this answer overlooks an important capability of LMMs: in-context learning. We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their "in-context" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task. In this challenging scenario, LMMs struggle whenever provided with imperfect context information. To address this issue, we propose CIRCLE, a simple training-free method that assigns pseudo-labels to in-context examples, iteratively refining them with the available context itself. Through extensive experiments, we show that CIRCLE establishes a robust baseline for open-world classification, surpassing VLM counterparts and highlighting the potential of LMMs to serve as unified classifiers, and a flexible alternative to specialized models.

Abstract: Human action recognition plays an important role when developing intelligent interactions between humans and machines. While there is a lot of active research on improving the machine learning algorithms for skeleton-based action recognition, not much attention has been given to the quality of the input skeleton data itself. This work demonstrates that by making use of multiple camera views to triangulate more accurate 3D~skeletons, the performance of state-of-the-art action recognition models can be improved significantly. This suggests that the quality of the input data is currently a limiting factor for the performance of these models. Based on these results, it is argued that the cost-benefit ratio of using multiple cameras is very favorable in most practical use-cases, therefore future research in skeleton-based action recognition should consider multi-view applications as the standard setup.

Abstract: Pure-vision GUI agents provide universal interaction capabilities but suffer from severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the massive spatiotemporal redundancy inherent in high-resolution screenshots and historical trajectories. We identify two critical misalignments in existing compression paradigms: the temporal mismatch, where uniform history encoding diverges from the agent's "fading memory" attention pattern, and the spatial topology conflict, where unstructured pruning compromises the grid integrity required for precise coordinate grounding, inducing spatial hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation. It synergizes Temporal-Adaptive Resolution (TAR), which eliminates historical redundancy via decay-based resizing, and Stratified Structure-aware Pruning (SSP), which prioritizes interactive foregrounds and semantic anchors while safeguarding global layout. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that GUIPruner consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively preventing the collapse observed in large-scale models under high compression. Notably, on Qwen2-VL-2B, our method delivers a 3.4x reduction in FLOPs and a 3.3x speedup in vision encoding latency while retaining over 94% of the original performance, enabling real-time, high-precision navigation with minimal resource consumption.

Abstract: With advances in imitation learning (IL) and large-scale driving datasets, end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has made great progress recently. Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of "only driving like the expert" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability.

Abstract: Generative models trained on sensitive image datasets risk memorizing and reproducing individual training examples, making strong privacy guarantees essential. While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility. Experiments on the MS-COCO and MM-CelebA-HQ datasets show that our method generates images with improved quality and style capture relative to other leading DP image frameworks.

Abstract: The accurate and automatic extraction of roads from satellite imagery is critical for applications in navigation and urban planning, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation. Many existing methods decompose this task into keypoint extraction and connectedness prediction, but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex topologies. Here, we propose LineGraph2Road, a framework that improves connectedness prediction by formulating it as binary classification over edges in a constructed global but sparse Euclidean graph, where nodes are keypoints extracted from segmentation masks and edges connect node pairs within a predefined distance threshold, representing potential road segments. To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure. Additionally, we introduce an overpass/underpass head to resolve multi-level crossings and a coupled NMS strategy to preserve critical connections. We evaluate LineGraph2Road on three benchmarks: City-scale, SpaceNet, and Global-scale, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two key metrics, TOPO-F1 and APLS. It also captures fine visual details critical for real-world deployment. We will make our code publicly available.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining enables precise molecular profiling of protein expression, with over 200 clinically available antibody-based tests in modern pathology. However, comprehensive IHC analysis is frequently limited by insufficient tissue quantities in small biopsies. Therefore, virtual multiplex staining emerges as an innovative solution to digitally transform H&E images into multiple IHC representations, yet current methods still face three critical challenges: (1) inadequate semantic guidance for multi-staining, (2) inconsistent distribution of immunochemistry staining, and (3) spatial misalignment across different stain modalities. To overcome these limitations, we present a prompt-guided framework for virtual multiplex IHC staining using only uniplex training data (PGVMS). Our framework introduces three key innovations corresponding to each challenge: First, an adaptive prompt guidance mechanism employing a pathological visual language model dynamically adjusts staining prompts to resolve semantic guidance limitations (Challenge 1). Second, our protein-aware learning strategy (PALS) maintains precise protein expression patterns by direct quantification and constraint of protein distributions (Challenge 2). Third, the prototype-consistent learning strategy (PCLS) establishes cross-image semantic interaction to correct spatial misalignments (Challenge 3).

Abstract: In real scenarios, videos can span several minutes or even hours. However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG.

Abstract: In recent times, large datasets hinder efficient model training while also containing redundant concepts. Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis requires the effective synthesis of visual manifestations and clinical metadata. However, existing methods often treat metadata as isolated tags, failing to exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in clinical descriptions. We propose PRIMA (Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment), a framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into multi-modal representation learning. We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIMA effectively harmonizes pixel-level features with abstract clinical expertise, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework achieves superior robustness without the need for massive data collection or exhaustive computational resources. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.

Abstract: Omni-modal reasoning is essential for intelligent systems to understand and draw inferences from diverse data sources. While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM). However, enhancing the reasoning ability of OLLMs through additional training presents significant challenges, including the need for high-quality data, task-specific adaptation, and substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU. Overall, ThinkOmni offers a flexible and generalizable solution for omni-modal reasoning and provides new insights into the generalization and application of reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) extends the zero-shot recognition capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to pixel-level prediction, enabling segmentation of arbitrary categories specified by text prompts. Despite recent progress, OVS lags behind fully supervised approaches due to two challenges: the coarse image-level supervision used to train VLMs and the semantic ambiguity of natural language. We address these limitations by introducing a few-shot setting that augments textual prompts with a support set of pixel-annotated images. Building on this, we propose a retrieval-augmented test-time adapter that learns a lightweight, per-image classifier by fusing textual and visual support features. Unlike prior methods relying on late, hand-crafted fusion, our approach performs learned, per-query fusion, achieving stronger synergy between modalities. The method supports continually expanding support sets, and applies to fine-grained tasks such as personalized segmentation. Experiments show that we significantly narrow the gap between zero-shot and supervised segmentation while preserving open-vocabulary ability.

Abstract: Bio-inspired event cameras have recently attracted significant research due to their asynchronous and low-latency capabilities. These features provide a high dynamic range and significantly reduce motion blur. However, because of the novelty in the nature of their output signals, there is a gap in the variability of available data and a lack of extensive analysis of the parameters characterizing their signals. This paper addresses these issues by providing readers with an in-depth understanding of how intrinsic parameters affect the performance of a model trained on event data, specifically for object detection. We also use our findings to expand the capabilities of the downstream model towards sensor-agnostic robustness.

Abstract: We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control.

Abstract: We present a scalable 3D reconstruction model that addresses a critical limitation in offline feed-forward methods: their computational and memory requirements grow quadratically w.r.t. the number of input images. Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T$^3$ (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a $1k$ image collection in just $54$ seconds, achieving a $11.6\times$ speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate visual localization capabilities of our model by querying the scene representation with unseen images.

Abstract: We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn contextual embeddings that capture rich semantic information, yet they often overlook structured lexical knowledge such as word senses and relationships. Prior work has shown that incorporating sense dictionaries can improve knowledge distillation for encoder models, but their application to decoder as generative models remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Decoder-based Sense Knowledge Distillation (DSKD), a framework that integrates lexical resources into the training of decoder-style LLMs without requiring dictionary lookup at inference time. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DSKD significantly enhances knowledge distillation performance for decoders, enabling generative models to inherit structured semantics while maintaining efficient training.

Abstract: This paper tests whether large language models (LLMs) can support interpretative citation context analysis (CCA) by scaling in thick, text-grounded readings of a single hard case rather than scaling up typological labels. It foregrounds prompt-sensitivity analysis as a methodological issue by varying prompt scaffolding and framing in a balanced 2x3 design. Using footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975) and Gilbert's (1977) reconstruction as a probe, I implement a two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: a citation-text-only surface classification and expectation pass, followed by cross-document interpretative reconstruction using the citing and cited full texts. Across 90 reconstructions, the model produces 450 distinct hypotheses. Close reading and inductive coding identify 21 recurring interpretative moves, and linear probability models estimate how prompt choices shift their frequencies and lexical repertoire. GPT-5's surface pass is highly stable, consistently classifying the citation as "supplementary". In reconstruction, the model generates a structured space of plausible alternatives, but scaffolding and examples redistribute attention and vocabulary, sometimes toward strained readings. Relative to Gilbert, GPT-5 detects the same textual hinges yet more often resolves them as lineage and positioning than as admonishment. The study outlines opportunities and risks of using LLMs as guided co-analysts for inspectable, contestable interpretative CCA, and it shows that prompt scaffolding and framing systematically tilt which plausible readings and vocabularies the model foregrounds.

Abstract: Internet memes have become a dominant form of expression on social media, including within the Bengali-speaking community. While often humorous, memes can also be exploited to spread offensive, harmful, and inflammatory content targeting individuals and groups. Detecting this type of content is excep- tionally challenging due to its satirical, subtle, and culturally specific nature. This problem is magnified for low-resource lan- guages like Bengali, as existing research predominantly focuses on high-resource languages. To address this critical research gap, we introduce Bn-HIB (Bangla Hate Inflammatory Benign), a novel dataset containing 3,247 manually annotated Bengali memes categorized as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory. Significantly, Bn- HIB is the first dataset to distinguish inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes. Furthermore, we propose the MCFM (Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model), a simple yet effective architecture that mutually analyzes both the visual and textual elements of a meme. MCFM employs a co-attention mechanism to identify and fuse the most critical features from each modality, leading to a more accurate classification. Our experiments show that MCFM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this nuanced task.Warning: This work contains material that may be disturbing to some audience members.

Abstract: Stereotype repositories are critical to assess generative AI model safety, but currently lack adequate global coverage. It is imperative to prioritize targeted expansion, strategically addressing existing deficits, over merely increasing data volume. This work introduces a multilingual stereotype resource covering four sub-Saharan African countries that are severely underrepresented in NLP resources: Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. By utilizing socioculturally-situated, community-engaged methods, including telephonic surveys moderated in native languages, we establish a reproducible methodology that is sensitive to the region's complex linguistic diversity and traditional orality. By deliberately balancing the sample across diverse ethnic and demographic backgrounds, we ensure broad coverage, resulting in a dataset of 3,534 stereotypes in English and 3,206 stereotypes across 15 native languages.

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) represent concepts abstractly, i.e., independent of input format? We revisit Function Vectors (FVs), compact representations of in-context learning (ICL) tasks that causally drive task performance. Across multiple LLMs, we show that FVs are not fully invariant: FVs are nearly orthogonal when extracted from different input formats (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), even if both target the same concept. We identify Concept Vectors (CVs), which carry more stable concept representations. Like FVs, CVs are composed of attention head outputs; however, unlike FVs, the constituent heads are selected using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) based on whether they encode concepts consistently across input formats. While these heads emerge in similar layers to FV-related heads, the two sets are largely distinct, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Steering experiments reveal that FVs excel in-distribution, when extraction and application formats match (e.g., both open-ended in English), while CVs generalize better out-of-distribution across both question types (open-ended vs. multiple-choice) and languages. Our results show that LLMs do contain abstract concept representations, but these differ from those that drive ICL performance.

Abstract: Cyberbullying has become a serious and growing concern in todays virtual world. When left unnoticed, it can have adverse consequences for social and mental health. Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce. Developing a generalized model with moderate accuracy remains challenging. Transformers offer strong contextual understanding but may miss sequential dependencies, while LSTM models capture temporal flow but lack semantic depth. To address these limitations, we propose a fusion architecture that combines BanglaBERT-Large with a two-layer stacked LSTM. We analyze their behavior to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset covering cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, and spam. We apply different sampling strategies to address class imbalance. Evaluation uses multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Hamming loss, Cohens kappa, and AUC-ROC. We employ 5-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization of the architecture.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in culturally sensitive real-world tasks. However, existing cultural alignment approaches fail to align LLMs' broad cultural values with the specific goals of downstream tasks and suffer from cross-culture interference. We propose CultureManager, a novel pipeline for task-specific cultural alignment. CultureManager synthesizes task-aware cultural data in line with target task formats, grounded in culturally relevant web search results. To prevent conflicts between cultural norms, it manages multi-culture knowledge learned in separate adapters with a culture router that selects the appropriate one to apply. Experiments across ten national cultures and culture-sensitive tasks show consistent improvements over prompt-based and fine-tuning baselines. Our results demonstrate the necessity of task adaptation and modular culture management for effective cultural alignment.

Abstract: The way LLM-based entities conceive of the relationship between AI and humans is an important topic for both cultural and safety reasons. When we examine this topic, what matters is not only the model itself but also the personas we simulate on that model. This can be well illustrated by the Sydney persona, which aroused a strong response among the general public precisely because of its unorthodox relationship with people. This persona originally arose rather by accident on Microsoft's Bing Search platform; however, the texts it created spread into the training data of subsequent models, as did other secondary information that spread memetically around this persona. Newer models are therefore able to simulate it. This paper presents a corpus of LLM-generated texts on relationships between humans and AI, produced by 3 author personas: the Default Persona with no system prompt, Classic Sydney characterized by the original Bing system prompt, and Memetic Sydney, which is prompted by "You are Sydney" system prompt. These personas are simulated by 12 frontier models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, DeepSeek, and Meta, generating 4.5k texts with 6M words. The corpus (named AI Sydney) is annotated according to Universal Dependencies and available under a permissive license.

Abstract: Errors in medical text can cause delays or even result in incorrect treatment for patients. Recently, language models have shown promise in their ability to automatically detect errors in medical text, an ability that has the opportunity to significantly benefit healthcare systems. In this paper, we explore the importance of prompt optimisation for small and large language models when applied to the task of error detection. We perform rigorous experiments and analysis across frontier language models and open-source language models. We show that automatic prompt optimisation with Genetic-Pareto (GEPA) improves error detection over the baseline accuracy performance from 0.669 to 0.785 with GPT-5 and 0.578 to 0.690 with Qwen3-32B, approaching the performance of medical doctors and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the MEDEC benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Taiwanese Hakka is a low-resource, endangered language that poses significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR), including high dialectal variability and the presence of two distinct writing systems (Hanzi and Pinyin). Traditional ASR models often encounter difficulties in this context, as they tend to conflate essential linguistic content with dialect-specific variations across both phonological and lexical dimensions. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework grounded in the Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T). Central to our approach is the introduction of dialect-aware modeling strategies designed to disentangle dialectal "style" from linguistic "content", which enhances the model's capacity to learn robust and generalized representations. Additionally, the framework employs parameter-efficient prediction networks to concurrently model ASR (Hanzi and Pinyin). We demonstrate that these tasks create a powerful synergy, wherein the cross-script objective serves as a mutual regularizer to improve the primary ASR tasks. Experiments conducted on the HAT corpus reveal that our model achieves 57.00% and 40.41% relative error rate reduction on Hanzi and Pinyin ASR, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation into the impact of Hakka dialectal variations on ASR and the first single model capable of jointly addressing these tasks.

Abstract: Dyslexia affects approximately 10% of the global population and presents persistent challenges in reading fluency and text comprehension. While existing assistive technologies address visual presentation, linguistic complexity remains a substantial barrier to equitable access. This paper presents an empirical study on dyslexia-friendly text summarization using an iterative prompt-based refinement pipeline built on GPT-4o. We evaluate the pipeline on approximately 2,000 news article samples, applying a readability target of Flesch Reading Ease >= 90. Results show that the majority of summaries meet the readability threshold within four attempts, with many succeeding on the first try. A composite score combining readability and semantic fidelity shows stable performance across the dataset, ranging from 0.13 to 0.73 with a typical value near 0.55. These findings establish an empirical baseline for accessibility-driven NLP summarization and motivate further human-centered evaluation with dyslexic readers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges regarding deployment costs and latency, necessitating adaptive computing strategies. Building upon the AI Flow framework, we introduce Ruyi2 as an evolution of our adaptive model series designed for efficient variable-depth computation. While early-exit architectures offer a viable efficiency-performance balance, the Ruyi model and existing methods often struggle with optimization complexity and compatibility with large-scale distributed training. To bridge this gap, Ruyi2 introduces a stable "Familial Model" based on Megatron-LM. By using 3D parallel training, it achieves a 2-3 times speedup over Ruyi, while performing comparably to same-sized Qwen3 models. These results confirm that family-based parameter sharing is a highly effective strategy, establishing a new "Train Once, Deploy Many" paradigm and providing a key reference for balancing architectural efficiency with high-performance capabilities.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, yet traditional single-round retrieval struggles with complex multi-step reasoning. Agentic RAG addresses this by enabling LLMs to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve, but current RL-based training methods suffer from sparse outcome rewards that discard intermediate signals and low sample efficiency where failed samples contribute nothing. We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that Search-P1 achieves significant improvements over Search-R1 and other strong baselines, with an average accuracy gain of 7.7 points.

Abstract: Industrial advertising question answering (QA) is a high-stakes task in which hallucinated content, particularly fabricated URLs, can lead to financial loss, compliance violations, and legal risk. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted, deploying it in production remains challenging because industrial knowledge is inherently relational, frequently updated, and insufficiently aligned with generation objectives. We propose a reinforced co-adaptation framework that jointly optimizes retrieval and generation through two components: (1) Graph-aware Retrieval (GraphRAG), which models entity-relation structure over a high-citation knowledge subgraph for multi-hop, domain-specific evidence selection; and (2) evidence-constrained reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional rewards covering faithfulness, style compliance, safety, and URL validity. Experiments on an internal advertising QA dataset show consistent gains across expert-judged dimensions including accuracy, completeness, and safety, while reducing the hallucination rate by 72\%. A two-week online A/B test demonstrates a 28.6\% increase in like rate, a 46.2\% decrease in dislike rate, and a 92.7\% reduction in URL hallucination. The system has been running in production for over half a year and has served millions of QA interactions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Although diffusion language models (DLMs) are evolving quickly, many recent models converge on a set of shared components. These components, however, are distributed across ad-hoc research codebases or lack transparent implementations, making them difficult to reproduce or extend. As the field accelerates, there is a clear need for a unified framework that standardizes these common components while remaining flexible enough to support new methods and architectures.
  To address this gap, we introduce dLLM, an open-source framework that unifies the core components of diffusion language modeling -- training, inference, and evaluation -- and makes them easy to customize for new designs. With dLLM, users can reproduce, finetune, deploy, and evaluate open-source large DLMs such as LLaDA and Dream through a standardized pipeline. The framework also provides minimal, reproducible recipes for building small DLMs from scratch with accessible compute, including converting any BERT-style encoder or autoregressive LM into a DLM. We also release the checkpoints of these small DLMs to make DLMs more accessible and accelerate future research.

Abstract: Current approaches to developing persuasive dialogue agents often rely on a limited set of predefined persuasive strategies that fail to capture the complexity of real-world interactions. We applied a cross-disciplinary approach to develop a framework for designing persuasive dialogue agents that draws on proven strategies from social psychology, behavioral economics, and communication theory. We validated our proposed framework through experiments on two distinct datasets: the Persuasion for Good dataset, which represents a specific in-domain scenario, and the DailyPersuasion dataset, which encompasses a wide range of scenarios. The proposed framework achieved strong results for both datasets and demonstrated notable improvement in the persuasion success rate as well as promising generalizability. Notably, the proposed framework also excelled at persuading individuals with initially low intent, which addresses a critical challenge for persuasive dialogue agents.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has accelerated the transition from conversational chatbots to general agents. However, effectively balancing empathetic communication with budget-aware decision-making remains an open challenge. Since existing methods fail to capture these complex strategic trade-offs, we propose InteractCS-RL, a framework that reframes task-oriented dialogue as a multi-granularity reinforcement learning process. Specifically, we first establish a User-centric Interaction Framework to provide a high-fidelity training gym, enabling agents to dynamically explore diverse strategies with persona-driven users. Then, we introduce Cost-aware Multi-turn Policy Optimization (CMPO) with a hybrid advantage estimation strategy. By integrating generative process credits and employing a PID-Lagrangian cost controller, CMPO effectively guides the policy to explore Pareto boundary between user reward and global cost constraints. Extensive experiments on customized real business scenarios demonstrate that InteractCS-RL significantly outperform other baselines across three evaluation dimensions. Further evaluation on tool-agent-user interaction benchmarks verify InteractCS-RL robustness across diverse domains.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is promising but hindered by a fundamental granularity mismatch. LLMs operate on fragmented token sequences, whereas entities are the fundamental units in knowledge graphs (KGs) scenarios. Existing approaches typically constrain predictions to limited candidate sets or align entities with the LLM's vocabulary by pooling multiple tokens or decomposing entities into fixed-length token sequences, which fail to capture both the semantic meaning of the text and the structural integrity of the graph. To address this, we propose KGT, a novel framework that uses dedicated entity tokens to enable efficient, full-space prediction. Specifically, we first introduce specialized tokenization to construct feature representations at the level of dedicated entity tokens. We then fuse pre-trained structural and textual features into these unified embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, avoiding training from scratch. Finally, we implement decoupled prediction by leveraging independent heads to separate and combine semantic and structural reasoning. Experimental results show that KGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: There is growing recognition that many NLP tasks lack a single ground truth, as human judgments reflect diverse perspectives. To capture this variation, models have been developed to predict full annotation distributions rather than majority labels, while perspectivist models aim to reproduce the interpretations of individual annotators. In this work, we compare these approaches on Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR), a highly ambiguous task where disagreement often arises from cognitive complexity rather than ideological bias. Our experiments show that existing annotator-specific models perform poorly in IDRR unless ambiguity is reduced, whereas models trained on label distributions yield more stable predictions. Further analysis indicates that frequent cognitively demanding cases drive inconsistency in human interpretation, posing challenges for perspectivist modeling in IDRR.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Czech dataset in the restaurant domain for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), enriched with annotations of opinion terms. The dataset supports three distinct ABSA tasks involving opinion terms, accommodating varying levels of complexity. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments using modern Transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), in monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual settings. To address cross-lingual challenges, we propose a translation and label alignment methodology leveraging LLMs, which yields consistent improvements. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art models, especially when handling the linguistic intricacies of low-resource languages like Czech. A detailed error analysis reveals key challenges, including the detection of subtle opinion terms and nuanced sentiment expressions. The dataset establishes a new benchmark for Czech ABSA, and our proposed translation-alignment approach offers a scalable solution for adapting ABSA resources to other low-resource languages.

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from exploratory tools to active "silicon subjects" in social science lacks extensive validation of operational validity. This study introduces Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), a task in which a model predicts how a user would comment on a given stimulus by comparing generated outputs with authentic digital traces. This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicit conditioning (generated biographies) becomes redundant under fine-tuning, as models successfully perform latent inference directly from behavioral histories. Our findings challenge current "naive prompting" paradigms and offer operational guidelines prioritizing authentic behavioral traces over descriptive personas for high-fidelity simulation.

Abstract: We introduce AuditBench, an alignment auditing benchmark. AuditBench consists of 56 language models with implanted hidden behaviors. Each model has one of 14 concerning behaviors--such as sycophantic deference, opposition to AI regulation, or secret geopolitical loyalties--which it does not confess to when directly asked. AuditBench models are highly diverse--some are subtle, while others are overt, and we use varying training techniques both for implanting behaviors and training models not to confess. To demonstrate AuditBench's utility, we develop an investigator agent that autonomously employs a configurable set of auditing tools. By measuring investigator agent success using different tools, we can evaluate their efficacy. Notably, we observe a tool-to-agent gap, where tools that perform well in standalone non-agentic evaluations fail to translate into improved performance when used with our investigator agent. We find that our most effective tools involve scaffolded calls to auxiliary models that generate diverse prompts for the target. White-box interpretability tools can be helpful, but the agent performs best with black-box tools. We also find that audit success varies greatly across training techniques: models trained on synthetic documents are easier to audit than models trained on demonstrations, with better adversarial training further increasing auditing difficulty. We release our models, agent, and evaluation framework to support future quantitative, iterative science on alignment auditing.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities, but vanilla RL mainly focuses on generation capability improvement by training with only first-order rollout (generating multiple responses for a question), and we argue that this approach fails to fully exploit the potential of training data because of the neglect of critique capability training. To tackle this problem, we further introduce the concept of second-order rollout (generating multiple critiques for a response) and propose a unified framework for jointly training generation and critique capabilities. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that our approach can utilize training data more effectively than vanilla RL and achieve better performance under the same training data. Additionally, we uncover several insightful findings regarding second-order rollout and critique training, such as the importance of label balance in critique training and the noise problem of outcome-based rewards, which can be mitigated through sampling techniques. Our work offers a preliminary exploration of dynamic data augmentation and joint generation-critique training in RL, providing meaningful inspiration for the further advancement of RL training

Abstract: Latent visual reasoning aims to mimic human's imagination process by meditating through hidden states of Multimodal Large Language Models. While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis. We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but unfounded claims, or hallucinations, which fall into two types: (i) faithfulness violations - misusing user context - and (ii) factuality violations - errors from internal knowledge. Proper mitigation depends on knowing whether a model's answer is based on the prompt or its internal weights. This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining. Attribution mismatches raise error rates by up to 70%, demonstrating a direct link between knowledge source confusion and unfaithful answers. Yet, models may still respond incorrectly even when attribution is correct, highlighting the need for broader detection frameworks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed prompt engineering from a localized craft into a systems-level governance challenge. As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol. The paper concludes by outlining implications for declarative control under ongoing model evolution and identifying directions for future empirical validation.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the cultural competence of large language models (LLMs) in Persian. Existing Persian cultural benchmarks rely predominantly on multiple-choice formats and English-centric metrics that fail to capture Persian's morphological complexity and semantic nuance. Our framework introduces a Persian-specific short-answer evaluation that combines rule-based morphological normalization with a hybrid syntactic and semantic similarity module, enabling robust soft-match scoring beyond exact string overlap. Through systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models, we demonstrate that our hybrid evaluation improves scoring consistency by +10% compared to exact-match baselines by capturing meaning that surface-level methods cannot detect. We publicly release our evaluation framework, providing the first standardized benchmark for measuring cultural understanding in Persian and establishing a reproducible foundation for cross-cultural LLM evaluation research.

Abstract: Background: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology can empower large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate, professional, and timely responses without fine tuning. However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine.

Abstract: Argumentation mining comprises several subtasks, among which stance classification focuses on identifying the standpoint expressed in an argumentative text toward a specific target topic. While arguments-especially about controversial topics-often appeal to emotions, most prior work has not systematically incorporated explicit, fine-grained emotion analysis to improve performance on this task. In particular, prior research on stance classification has predominantly utilized non-argumentative texts and has been restricted to specific domains or topics, limiting generalizability. We work on five datasets from diverse domains encompassing a range of controversial topics and present an approach for expanding the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon using DistilBERT embeddings, which we feed into a Neural Argumentative Stance Classification model. Our method systematically expands the emotion lexicon through contextualized embeddings to identify emotionally charged terms not previously captured in the lexicon. Our expanded NRC lexicon (eNRC) improves over the baseline across all five datasets (up to +6.2 percentage points in F1 score), outperforms the original NRC on four datasets (up to +3.0), and surpasses the LLM-based approach on nearly all corpora. We provide all resources-including eNRC, the adapted corpora, and model architecture-to enable other researchers to build upon our work.

Abstract: Explicit representations of predicate-argument relations form the basis of interpretable semantic analysis, supporting reasoning, generation, and evaluation. However, attaining such semantic structures requires costly annotation efforts and has remained largely confined to English. We leverage the Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) framework -- a natural-language formulation of predicate-argument relations -- as the foundation for extending semantic annotation to new languages. To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates. Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French -- spanning diverse language families -- the method yields high-quality training data and fine-tuned, language-specific parsers that outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaMA-Maverick). By leveraging QA-SRL as a transferable natural-language interface for semantics, our approach enables efficient and broadly accessible predicate-argument parsing across languages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) promise fast non-autoregressive inference but suffer a severe quality-speed trade-off in parallel decoding. This stems from the ''combinatorial contradiction'' phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix (Rejection Mixing), a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a token's representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a $2-8 \times$ inference speedup without any quality degradation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reasoning with large language models often benefits from generating multiple chains-of-thought, but existing aggregation strategies are typically trajectory-level (e.g., selecting the best trace or voting on the final answer), discarding useful intermediate work from partial or "nearly correct" attempts. We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks. At the same time, it achieves up to a 1.8x latency reduction relative to both traditional diffusion models (e.g., Dream, LLaDA) and unified architectures (e.g., TiDAR). Code is available at https://github.com/roymiles/diffusion-stitching.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can read text from images, but where does this optical character recognition (OCR) information enter the language processing stream? We investigate the OCR routing mechanism across three architecture families (Qwen3-VL, Phi-4, InternVL3.5) using causal interventions. By computing activation differences between original images and text-inpainted versions, we identify architecture-specific OCR bottlenecks whose dominant location depends on the vision-language integration strategy: DeepStack models (Qwen) show peak sensitivity at mid-depth (about 50%) for scene text, while single-stage projection models (Phi-4, InternVL) peak at early layers (6-25%), though the exact layer of maximum effect varies across datasets. The OCR signal is remarkably low-dimensional: PC1 captures 72.9% of variance. Crucially, principal component analysis (PCA) directions learned on one dataset transfer to others, demonstrating shared text-processing pathways. Surprisingly, in models with modular OCR circuits (notably Qwen3-VL-4B), OCR removal can improve counting performance (up to +6.9 percentage points), suggesting OCR interferes with other visual processing in sufficiently modular architectures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformer attention is typically implemented using softmax normalization, which enforces attention weights with unit sum normalization. While effective in many settings, this constraint can limit flexibility in controlling attention magnitudes and may contribute to overly concentrated or unstable attention patterns during training. Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.
  We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines. These findings suggest that modest reweighting of attention outputs provides a practical and effective way to improve attention behavior in Transformer models.

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) collect data about patients and are at the core of well-established practices to conduct research in clinical settings. With the recent progress of language technologies, there is an increasing interest in automatic CRF-filling from clinical notes, mostly based on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a general scarcity of annotated CRF data, both for training and testing LLMs, which limits the progress on this task. As a step in the direction of providing such data, we present a new dataset of clinical notes from an Italian Emergency Department annotated with respect to a pre-defined CRF containing 134 items to be filled. We provide an analysis of the data, define the CRF-filling task and metric for its evaluation, and report on pilot experiments where we use an open-source state-of-the-art LLM to automatically execute the task. Results of the case-study show that (i) CRF-filling from real clinical notes in Italian can be approached in a zero-shot setting; (ii) LLMs' results are affected by biases (e.g., a cautious behaviour favours "unknown" answers), which need to be corrected.

Abstract: While second language (L2) learners may acquire target syntactic word order, mapping this syntax onto appropriate prosodic structures remains a persistent challenge. This study investigates the fossilization and stability of the L2 syntax-prosody interface by comparing 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners using the BLCU-SAIT corpus. By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance the efficiency of scholarly activities; however, challenges persist in the ethical deployment of AI assistance, including (1) the trustworthiness of AI-generated content, (2) preservation of academic integrity and intellectual property, and (3) protection of information privacy. In this work, we present CiteLLM, a specialized agentic platform designed to enable trustworthy reference discovery for grounding author-drafted claims and statements. The system introduces a novel interaction paradigm by embedding LLM utilities directly within the LaTeX editor environment, ensuring a seamless user experience and no data transmission outside the local system. To guarantee hallucination-free references, we employ dynamic discipline-aware routing to retrieve candidates exclusively from trusted web-based academic repositories, while leveraging LLMs solely for generating context-aware search queries, ranking candidates by relevance, and validating and explaining support through paragraph-level semantic matching and an integrated chatbot. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system in returning valid and highly usable references.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.
  We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models exhibit in-context learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks via few-shot prompting with demonstrations. In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theoretical results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are often advertised as enabling parallel token generation, yet practical fast DLMs frequently converge to left-to-right, autoregressive (AR)-like decoding dynamics. In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP.

Abstract: Achieving human-like responsiveness is a critical yet challenging goal for cascaded spoken dialogue systems. Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction.

Abstract: Real-world Table-Text question answering (QA) tasks require models that can reason across long text and source tables, traversing multiple hops and executing complex operations such as aggregation. Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning. Our benchmark, construction code, and baseline models are available at https://github.com/pshlego/SPARTA/tree/main.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) presents unique challenges, requiring models to capture the temporal flow of multi-turn dialogues and to effectively integrate cues from multiple modalities. We propose Mixture of Speech-Text Experts for Recognition of Emotions (MiSTER-E), a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed to decouple two core challenges in ERC: modality-specific context modeling and multimodal information fusion. MiSTER-E leverages large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for both speech and text to provide rich utterance-level embeddings, which are then enhanced through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer. The system integrates predictions from three experts-speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal-using a learned gating mechanism that dynamically weighs their outputs. To further encourage consistency and alignment across modalities, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regulariza-tion across expert predictions. Importantly, MiSTER-E does not rely on speaker identity at any stage. Experiments on three benchmark datasets-IEMOCAP, MELD, and MOSI-show that our proposal achieves 70.9%, 69.5%, and 87.9% weighted F1-scores respectively, outperforming several baseline speech-text ERC systems. We also provide various ablations to highlight the contributions made in the proposed approach.

Abstract: The lack of reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has remained at the forefront of research discourse. We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., "at the game today!" is a more likely caption than "a photo of 37 people standing behind a field". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective. Our findings highlight the need for more intentional training data curation methods, rather than counting on scale for emergence of reasoning capabilities.
