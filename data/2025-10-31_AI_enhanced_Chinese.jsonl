To\naddress this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50\nproblems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International\nMathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original\nproblems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.\nMoreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a\nproof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental\nresults across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model\nachieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.\nBeyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising\nscaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench.

In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability.

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks.
