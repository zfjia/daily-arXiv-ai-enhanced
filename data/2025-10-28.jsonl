Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a\nstrict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the\nbehavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT\nstructure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an\nextensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:\n\\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.\nWhen afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy\noptimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the\npolicy to degenerate to a direct \\texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome\nholds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in\nformat is persistent even when the complex \\texttt{<think><answer>} format is\nassigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a\nseries of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear\nhierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,\na preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or\nstrong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful\nconvergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven\nby the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have\nsufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior.

Recent frameworks try to\naddress this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt\nlightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these\nadvancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining\nprocess is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;\nsecond, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of\nthe current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,\nan efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by\nincorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples\nare more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.\nAdditionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that\noptimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their\ntimeliness.

This\nmethod is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the\naggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise\nprediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and\nnon-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we\nsuppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around\na certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises\nof non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain\ntime step.

However, real-world datasets often suffer from the\nproblem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is\nmissing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods\ntypically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep\nneural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across\nmodalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a\nlow-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible\nmultimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned\nproblem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance\nrepresentation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize\nincomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for\ncross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we\nmodel and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible\nstructure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow\nmodel, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent\nspace of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the\nreconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight\nTransformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating\nthe overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the\nlow-rank Transformer.

Prior work\nprimarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather\nthan visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by\namplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.\nHowever, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where\nattention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and\nneglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without\nadjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect\nareas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided\nCross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual\nsaliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or \"gaze\nshifts\", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify\nattention to both salient visual information and the user query at each\ndecoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant\ntokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for\nwell-integrated representation.

We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how\nMLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed\nthrough shuffling.

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays.

The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance.

We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively\nfilter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when\ndiscarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted\nbest-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative\nimprovements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for\nBERTScore.

While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,\nefficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.\nConvolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of\nvoxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature\nmatching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct\ncorrespondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin\nneighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to\nexcessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent\nlocality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range\ncorrespondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a\nRecurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching\nregion toward more promising positions.

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual\nImage Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and\nfactual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence\nfrom the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched\nprompts to guide generation.

Existing\nresearch has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,\nand emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for\nforward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary\ndatasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United\nStates, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI\nadoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal\nsplits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using\nmultiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and\nhybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy\nand qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task\nprompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer\nadvantages on short-term trends.

Diffusion bridge models have\nrecently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding\nFiltered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data\nconsistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data\nconsistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed\nimage with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by\nintegrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,\nwe propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a\nnovel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the\ndistribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the\nincomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data\nin sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We\nembed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under\ncertain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.\nIn addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of\nstochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme\nfor the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from\nthree types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and\ntruncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated\nstate-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and\ndomain-shift evaluations."}

This paper\ninvestigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing\nanomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing\nthe embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse\n2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs\ncan act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video\ninto text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate\nfour open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and\nprivacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some\nmodels, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially\nfull-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.\nThese results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially\nsalient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity\nobfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial\ngrounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight\nspatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,\nand privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions\nzero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for\nembodied, real-world video understanding.

One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate\ntemporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional\nkeyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address\nthis, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future\ntimesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This\ntransforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model\ncontinuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio\ncues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also\nenables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead\ntarget, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the\ntemporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity\nand consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while\nsmaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human\nanimation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,\nidentity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal\nconditioning across several different architectures.

In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end\ngenerative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive\n(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image\nsynthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive\nflow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled\nimplicitly by an autoregressive model.

A major obstacle in this field is a lack of\ndynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer\nlimited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide\nper-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we\npresent Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides\nper-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic\nintrinsics.
