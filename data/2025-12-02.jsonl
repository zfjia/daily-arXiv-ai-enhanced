Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality. Benchmarking experiments on open-sourced and frontier proprietary models reveal persistent gaps in predicting accurate, schema compliant outputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Beyond benchmarking, we further conduct training experiments to largely improve the model's structured output capability. We plan to make the benchmark available to the community."}

The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.\n  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity."}

Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types.

While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed \"PathReasoning\", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology."}

To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline.

Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment.

To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged."}

A recently proposed large pre-trained model, wav2vec 2.0, was seminal for several other works on pre-training large models on speech data. Many models are being pre-trained using the same architecture as wav2vec 2.0 and are getting state-of-the-art in various speech-related tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that the data used during the pre-training of these wav2vec2-based models can impact the model's performance in downstream tasks, and this should be taken into consideration before utilizing these models. However, few works have proposed investigating further how the transfer knowledge of these pre-trained models behaves in different languages, even when the target language differs from the one used during the model's pre-training. Our work aims to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of these wav2vec2-based models. We performed several fine-tuning experiments on the speech recognition task in 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained models. The results of our experiments showed us that the size of data used during the pre-training of these models is not as important to the final performance as the diversity. We noticed that the performance of Indo-European languages is superior to non-Indo-European languages in the evaluated models. We have observed a positive cross-lingual transfer of knowledge using monolingual models, which was evident in all the languages we used, but more pronounced when the language used during pre-training was more similar to the downstream task language. With these findings, we aim to assist the scientific community in utilizing existing wav2vec2-based pre-trained models, as well as facilitate the pre-training of new ones."}

A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations.

Insight-A makes two efforts: I) attribute misinformation to forgery sources, and II) an effective pipeline with hierarchical reasoning that detects distortions across modalities. Specifically, to attribute misinformation to forgery traces based on generation patterns, we devise cross-attribution prompting (CAP) to model the sophisticated correlations between perception and reasoning. Meanwhile, to reduce the subjectivity of human-annotated prompts, automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) is used for task adaptation on MLLMs. Additionally, we design image captioning (IC) to achieve visual details for enhancing cross-modal consistency checking.

Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings.

Therefore, in this paper, we present Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Goal-oriented Dialogue (NRPA-GD), a novel dialogue policy planning method that completely avoids specific model training by utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate behaviors of user and system at the same time. Specifically, NRPA-GD constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework of nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process. The experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show that NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and specifically pre-trained model-based methods. Impressively, NRPA-GD surpasses ChatGPT and pre-trained policy models with only a 0.6-billion-parameter LLM. The proposed approach further demonstrates the advantages and novelty of employing planning methods on LLMs to solve practical planning tasks."}

In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones."}

However, LLMs often exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks, where their choices are influenced by factors like answer position or option symbols rather than the content. This bias undermines the reliability of MCQ as an evaluation framework. Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability.

LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%."}

We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems."}

These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability.

The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions.

Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains.

In this paper, we introduce MICM, a novel, model-agnostic jailbreak method that targets the aggregate value structure reflected in LLM responses. Drawing on conceptual morphology theory, MICM encodes specific configurations of nuanced concepts into a fixed prompt template through a predefined set of phrases. These phrases act as conceptual triggers, steering model outputs toward a specific value stance without triggering conventional safety filters. We evaluate MICM across five advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen3-8B.

However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality.

The GGP and its persona prompts are designed to be easily plugged into prompts for all types of LLMs and tasks, steering models to generate responses aligned with the underlying German population. We evaluate GGP by prompting various LLMs to simulate survey response distributions across diverse topics, demonstrating that GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers, particularly under data scarcity. Furthermore, we analyze how the representativity and attribute selection within persona prompts affect alignment with population responses. Our findings suggest that GGP provides a potentially valuable resource for research on LLM-based social simulations that enables more systematic explorations of population-aligned persona prompting in NLP and social science research."}

For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9). These results show that a compact student, guided by powerful teachers, can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent."}

However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions.

To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results.

Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders."}

However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction."}

Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders.

The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization.

In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training.

In recent years, multimodal humor has become a prevalent form of online communication, especially among Gen Z, highlighting the need for AI systems capable of integrating visual understanding with humorous language generation. However, existing data-driven approaches lack explicit modeling or theoretical grounding of humor, often producing literal descriptions that fail to capture its underlying cognitive mechanisms, resulting in the generated image descriptions that are fluent but lack genuine humor or cognitive depth. To address this limitation, we propose HUMORCHAIN (HUmor-guided Multi-step Orchestrated Reasoning Chain for Image Captioning), a theory-guided multi-stage reasoning framework. It integrates visual semantic parsing, humor- and psychology-based reasoning, and a fine-tuned discriminator for humor evaluation, forming an interpretable and controllable cognitive reasoning chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly embed cognitive structures from humor theories into multimodal humor generation, enabling a structured reasoning process from visual understanding to humor creation. Experiments on Meme-Image-No-Text, Oogiri-GO, and OxfordTVG-HIC datasets show that HUMORCHAIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in human humor preference, Elo/BT scores, and semantic diversity, demonstrating that theory-driven structured reasoning enables large language models to generate humor aligned with human perception."}

Our unified benchmark evaluates seven state-of-the-art methods, spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms. By systematically perturbing cues such as shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, and local continuity, we measure their impact on 3D output quality. Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families.

To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction."}

We further generalize the VF strategy to Iter-VF, a sequential test-time scaling (TTS) method that iteratively cycles the verification-generation process using the model's previous answer. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks (from mathematical reasoning to coding and agentic tasks) and various LLMs (from open-source 1B to cutting-edge commercial ones) confirm that VF with random answer consistently outperforms standard CoT with minimal computational overhead, and Iter-VF outperforms existing TTS strategies."}

We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances."}

However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability.

To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge.

Central to our approach is a cross-task, cross-species pretrained neural encoder, whose representations transfer to both attempted and imagined speech.

To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner.

Drawing from cognitive science, we align training dynamics with the Four Stages of Competence: models initially produce incorrect outputs without reasoning, then begin reasoning (but still fail), eventually reason effectively, and finally solve tasks without explicit reasoning. We find that reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at the stage of conscious competence, then declines as the model internalizes the task. Notably, after training, models retain performance even when reasoning is removed--suggesting it scaffolded learning but is no longer needed. This progression offers actionable insights: reasoning token dynamics can serve as a signal for diagnosing training stage, identifying convergence, and guiding early stopping.

We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation. The framework also exhibits versatility in various applications, including conditional generation from category labels, point clouds, text descriptions, and images, as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation."}

In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation. Our pipeline integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train effective small-scale models for specialized use cases. We demonstrate this approach through DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter domain-specific model tailored for fault diagnosis, root cause analysis, and repair recommendation in industrial settings. To evaluate model performance, we introduce four domain-specific benchmarks: multiple-choice questions (DiagnosticMCQ), question answering (DiagnosticQA), sentence completion (DiagnosticComp), and summarization (DiagnosticSum). DiagnosticSLM achieves up to 25% accuracy improvement over open-source models of comparable or larger size (2B-9B) on the MCQ task, while also outperforming or matching them in other tasks, demonstrating effective domain-specific reasoning and generalization capabilities."}

However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence.

Experimenting with the SemEval 2023 Task 3 taxonomy across the synthetic persuasion dataset, we demonstrate significant variations in detection performance across language agents.

In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection."}

Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance."}

Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as \"geo-sensors\" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., \"The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece.\" contains impacted location \"Mati\" and non-impacted locations \"Greece\" and \"Athens\". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders."}

Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released."}

We verify this mechanism via an ablation study, demonstrating that suppressing Layer 46 reduces the model's confidence in hallucinatory outputs by 81.8%.

Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks."}

To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI."}

Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs.

To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency.

To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups.

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM."}

Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity."}

To address this, we conducted a controlled Wizard of Oz (WOZ) experiment to elicit interactions with targeted affective trajectories. The resulting corpus, EmoWOZ-CS, contains 2,148 bilingual (Dutch-English) written dialogues from 179 participants across commercial aviation, e-commerce, online travel agencies, and telecommunication scenarios. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Evaluate WOZ-based operator-steered valence trajectories as a design for emotion research; (2) Quantify human annotation performance and variation, including divergences between self-reports and third-party judgments; (3) Benchmark detection and forward-looking emotion inference in real-time support. Findings show neutral dominates participant messages; desire and gratitude are the most frequent non-neutral emotions. Agreement is moderate for multilabel emotions and valence, lower for arousal and dominance; self-reports diverge notably from third-party labels, aligning most for neutral, gratitude, and anger. Objective strategies often elicit neutrality or gratitude, while suboptimal strategies increase anger, annoyance, disappointment, desire, and confusion. Some affective strategies (cheerfulness, gratitude) foster positive reciprocity, whereas others (apology, empathy) can also leave desire, anger, or annoyance. Temporal analysis confirms successful conversation-level steering toward prescribed trajectories, most distinctly for negative targets; positive and neutral targets yield similar final valence distributions. Benchmarks highlight the difficulty of forward-looking emotion inference from prior turns, underscoring the complexity of proactive emotion-aware support."}

This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization.

Using this framework, we conduct a case study on the preference annotation task, creating a dataset PreferRead that contains fine-grained annotator reading behaviors obtained from mouse tracking. PreferRead enables detailed analysis of how annotators navigate between a prompt and two candidate responses before selecting their preference. We find that annotators re-read a response in roughly half of all trials, most often revisiting the option they ultimately choose, and rarely revisit the prompt. Reading behaviors are also significantly related to annotation outcomes: re-reading is associated with higher inter-annotator agreement, whereas long reading paths and times are associated with lower agreement. These results demonstrate that reading processes provide a complementary cognitive dimension for understanding annotator reliability, decision-making and disagreement in complex, subjective NLP tasks.

The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/."}

Our contributions are twofold: (1) we create a new, balanced dataset of Chinese lyrics spanning multiple genres, and (2) we develop and fine-tune a domain-specific model, comparing its performance against zero-shot inference using the DeepSeek LLM.\n  We test two central hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that a fine-tuned model will outperform a zero-shot LLM baseline. Second, we hypothesize that performance is genre-dependent. Our experiments strongly confirm Hypothesis 2: structured genres (e.g. Folklore & Tradition) yield significantly higher attribution accuracy than more abstract genres (e.g. Love & Romance). Hypothesis 1 receives only partial support: fine-tuning improves robustness and generalization in Test1 (real-world data and difficult genres), but offers limited or ambiguous gains in Test2, a smaller, synthetically-augmented set. We show that the design limitations of Test2 (e.g., label imbalance, shallow lexical differences, and narrow genre sampling) can obscure the true effectiveness of fine-tuning.\n  Our work establishes the first benchmark for cross-genre Chinese lyric attribution, highlights the importance of genre-sensitive evaluation, and provides a public dataset and analytical framework for future research. We conclude with recommendations: enlarge and diversify test sets, reduce reliance on token-level data augmentation, balance author representation across genres, and investigate domain-adaptive pretraining as a pathway for improved attribution performance."}

However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy."}

Here, we present a pipeline to systematically probe attention mechanisms, and we illustrate its value by leveraging lexical ambiguity--where a single word has multiple meanings--to isolate attention mechanisms that contribute to word sense disambiguation. We take a \"developmental\" approach: first, using publicly available Pythia LM checkpoints, we identify inflection points in disambiguation performance for each LM in the suite; in 14M and 410M, we identify heads whose attention to disambiguating words covaries with overall disambiguation performance across development. We then stress-test the robustness of these heads to stimulus perturbations: in 14M, we find limited robustness, but in 410M, we identify multiple heads with surprisingly generalizable behavior. Then, in a causal analysis, we find that ablating the target heads demonstrably impairs disambiguation performance, particularly in 14M. We additionally reproduce developmental analyses of 14M across all of its random seeds. Together, these results suggest: that disambiguation benefits from a constellation of mechanisms, some of which (especially in 14M) are highly sensitive to the position and part-of-speech of the disambiguating cue; and that larger models (410M) may contain heads with more robust disambiguation behavior. They also join a growing body of work that highlights the value of adopting a developmental perspective when probing LM mechanisms."}

We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones.

To address this gap, we introduce AfriStereo, the first open-source African stereotype dataset and evaluation framework grounded in local socio-cultural contexts. Through community engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, we collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations. Looking ahead, AfriStereo opens pathways for future research on culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, offering key methodologies for the AI community on building more equitable, context-aware, and globally inclusive NLP technologies."}

ResearchArcade utilizes a coherent multi-table format with graph structures to organize data from different sources, including academic corpora from ArXiv and peer reviews from OpenReview, while capturing information with multiple modalities, such as text, figures, and tables.

However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss.

However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames.

To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

However, when both text and images exist in the database, similarity scores would differ in scale by modality. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, hinders accurate retrieval. Most existing studies address this issue with manually labeled data, e.g., by fine-tuning VLMs on them. In this work, we propose a similarity standardization approach with pseudo data construction. We first compute the mean and variance of the similarity scores between each query and its paired data in text or image modality. Using these modality-specific statistics, we standardize all similarity scores to compare on a common scale across modalities. These statistics are calculated from pseudo pairs, which are constructed by retrieving the text and image candidates with the highest cosine similarity to each query. We evaluate our method across seven VLMs using two multi-modal QA benchmarks (MMQA and WebQA), where each question requires retrieving either text or image data. Our experimental results show that our method significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA when the query and the target data belong to different modalities. Compared to E5-V, which addresses the modality gap through image captioning, we confirm that our method more effectively bridges the modality gap."}

Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections."}

We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines.

Existing text detectors typically rely on a single methodological paradigm and suffer from poor generalization and high false positive rates (FPR), especially on high-stakes academic text. We propose a theoretically grounded hybrid ensemble that systematically fuses three complementary detection paradigms: (i) a RoBERTa-based transformer classifier for deep semantic feature extraction, (ii) a GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, and (iii) a statistical linguistic feature analyzer capturing stylometric patterns. The core novelty lies in an optimized weighted voting framework, where ensemble weights are learned on the probability simplex to maximize F1-score rather than set heuristically. We provide a bias-variance analysis and empirically demonstrate low inter-model correlation (rho ~ 0.35-0.42), a key condition for variance reduction. Evaluated on a large-scale, multigenerator corpus of 30,000 documents, our system achieves 94.2% accuracy and an AUC of 0.978, with a 35% relative reduction in false positives on academic text. This yields a more reliable and ethically responsible detector for real-world deployment in education and other high-stakes domains."}

In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection."}

While DYNARTmo does not implement full task-dynamic second-order biomechanics, it adopts first-order task-space gesture specifications comparable to those used in articulatory phonology and integrates a simplified mechanism for distributing articulatory effort across multiple articulators. We first outline the conceptual relationship between task dynamics and DYNARTmo, emphasizing the distinction between high-level task-space trajectories and their low-level articulatory execution. We then present simulation results for a set of CV syllables that illustrate how jaw displacement varies as a function of both place of articulation (labial, apical, dorsal) and vowel context (/a/, /i/, /u/). The model reproduces empirically attested patterns of articulatory synergy, including jaw-supported apical closures, lower-lip elevation in bilabial stops, tongue-jaw co-movement, and saturation effects in labial constrictions. These results demonstrate that even with computationally simplified assumptions, DYNARTmo can generate realistic spatio-temporal movement patterns that capture key aspects of articulatory tradeoff and synergy across a range of consonant-vowel combinations."}

This question is increasingly relevant as a wide range of real-world user interactions involve refinement requests. However, prior studies have largely tested LMs' refinement abilities on verifiable tasks such as competition math or symbolic reasoning with simplified scaffolds, whereas users often pose open-ended queries and provide varying degrees of feedback on what they desire. The recent advent of reasoning models that exhibit self-reflection patterns in their chains-of-thought further motivates this question. To analyze this, we introduce RefineBench, a benchmark of 1,000 challenging problems across 11 domains paired with a checklist-based evaluation framework. We evaluate two refinement modes: (1) guided refinement, where an LM is provided natural language feedback, and (2) self-refinement, where LMs attempt to improve without guidance. In the self-refinement setting, even frontier LMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 achieve modest baseline scores of 31.3% and 29.1%, respectively, and most models fail to consistently improve across iterations (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro gains only +1.8%, while DeepSeek-R1 declines by -0.1%). By contrast, in guided refinement, both proprietary LMs and large open-weight LMs (>70B) can leverage targeted feedback to refine responses to near-perfect levels within five turns. These findings suggest that frontier LMs require breakthroughs to self-refine their incorrect responses, and that RefineBench provides a valuable testbed for tracking progress."}

Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT. These results highlight structured input as a simple yet effective lever for more efficient LLM reasoning."}

More importantly, most reinforcement learning (RL) methods in text-to-SQL leverage only the final binary execution outcome as the reward signal, a coarse-grained supervision that overlooks detailed structural and semantic errors from the perspective of rubrics.

Our framework first automatically generates query-specific evaluation rubrics for human-free annotation, linking them to interpretable critiques.

To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free.

To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm.

It comprises 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban areas, suburbs, forests, coastal regions) and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, foggy), featuring multiple UAV models (micro, small, medium-sized) and five modalities - RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, and DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor). Each frame provides 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core tasks related to UAVs such as 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and short-term trajectory forecasting. We further propose LGFusionNet, a LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline, and a dedicated UAV trajectory prediction baseline to facilitate benchmarking. With its controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations, UAV3D offers a public benchmark for advancing 3D perception of UAVs."}

Yet little is known about where such epistemic cues are internally represented within these models. Distinct from uncertainty quantification, which measures output confidence, this work examines input-side representational sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty in medical text. We curate a contrastive dataset of clinical statements varying in epistemic modality (e.g., 'is consistent with' vs. 'may be consistent with') and propose Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric that quantifies activation-level shifts induced by uncertainty cues. Our results show that LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, suggesting that epistemic information is progressively encoded in deeper layers. These findings reveal how linguistic uncertainty is internally represented in LLMs, offering insight into their interpretability and epistemic reliability."}

Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference. Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 demonstrate that DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based stylization methods across challenging style domains."}

To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence.

The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

These are often regarded as problematic, as violations of the Extension Condition. We show that, in fact, all of these phenomena can be explained without involving any EC violation. We first show that derivations using Sideward Merge are possible for all of these cases: these respect EC, though they involve some amount of optimality violations, with respect to Resource Restrictions cost functions, andthe amount of violation differs among these cases. We show that all the cases that involve large optimality violations can be derived in alternative ways involving neither EC nor the use of SM. The main remaining case (head-to-head movement) only involves SM with minimal violations of optimality (near equilibrium fluctuations). We analyze explicitly also the cases of multiple wh-fronting, clusters of clitics in Romance languages and possessor agreement construction in Korean, and how an explanation of these phenomena based on SM can be made compatible with the colored operad generators for phases and theta roles. We also show that the EC condition has a clear algebraic meaning in the mathematical formulation of Merge and is therefore an intrinsic structural algebraic constraint of the model, rather than an additional assumption. We also show that the minimal optimality violating SM plays a structural role in the Markovian properties of Merge, and we compare different optimality conditions coming from Minimal Search and from Resource Restriction in terms of their effect on the dynamics of the Hopf algebra Markov chain, in a simple explicit example."}

As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection."}

The proposed method incorporates a search space reduction technique to select relevant subsets from both source and target ontologies, which are then used to automatically construct prompts. Recognizing the scarcity of reference alignments for training, a novel LLM-based approach is introduced for generating a synthetic dataset. This process creates a corpus of ontology submodule pairs and their corresponding reference alignments, specifically designed to fine-tune an LLM for the ontology matching task. The proposed approach was evaluated on the Conference, Geolink, Enslaved, Taxon, and Hydrography datasets from the OAEI complex track. The results demonstrate that the LLM fine-tuned on the synthetically generated data exhibits superior performance compared to the non-fine-tuned base model.

Within the South Asian context, where the use of Romanized script for Indo-Aryan languages is widespread across social media and digital communication platforms, such usage continues to pose significant challenges for cutting-edge multilingual models. While a limited number of transliteration datasets and models are available for Indo-Aryan languages, they generally lack sufficient diversity in pronunciation and spelling variations, adequate code-mixed data for large language model (LLM) training, and low-resource adaptation.

However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs."}

To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity.

Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow.

The benchmark comprises 1,000 essays written by elementary and secondary school students, and a well-developed English writing error taxonomy.

However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception.

Workshop: LAW 2025: Bridging Language, Agent, and World Models", "summary": "To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying \"what to do\". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model."}

Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection."}

Speculative Decoding (SPD) mitigates this issue by verifying candidate tokens in parallel from a smaller draft model, yet its strict exact-match verification discards many semantically valid continuations. Moreover, existing training-based SPD methods often suffer from performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To this end, we propose Training-Free Loosely Speculative Decoding (FLy), a novel method that loosens the rigid verification criterion by leveraging the target model's self-corrective behavior to judge whether a draft-target mismatch remains semantically valid. FLy introduces a two-tier mechanism: an entropy-level gate that identifies whether the current token allows multiple plausible alternatives or is nearly deterministic, and a token-level deferred window that distinguishes genuine errors from differently worded yet semantically correct variants. To further reduce latency, we design a multi-level acceleration strategy that accelerates not only the target model but also the drafter itself. Owing to its training-free design, FLy composes seamlessly with arbitrary draft-target pairs and generalizes across models and domains without hyperparameter re-tuning. Experiments show that FLy preserves more than 99% of the target model's accuracy while achieving an average 2.81x speedup on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and 5.07x speedup on the 405B variant. Notably, on out-of-domain datasets, our method remains highly effective and outperforms the training-based method EAGLE-3 by 1.62x."}

There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking."}

Comparative analysis shows that these feature domains provide complementary temporal signals, with combined models outperforming any individual feature set. On a large-scale corpus, we achieve 76.7% accuracy for century-scale prediction and 26.1% for decade-scale classification, substantially above random baselines (20% and 2.3%). Under relaxed temporal precision, performance increases to 96.0% top-2 accuracy for centuries and 85.8% top-10 accuracy for decades.

This work develops a parallel corpus of accented-unaccented ślokas and conducts a controlled comparison of three strategies for automatic accent placement in Rigvedic verse: (i) full fine-tuning of ByT5, a byte-level Transformer that operates directly on Unicode combining marks, (ii) a from-scratch BiLSTM-CRF sequence-labeling baseline, and (iii) LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning atop ByT5.\n  Evaluation uses Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) for orthographic fidelity, plus a task-specific Diacritic Error Rate (DER) that isolates accent edits. Full ByT5 fine-tuning attains the lowest error across all metrics; LoRA offers strong efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and BiLSTM-CRF serves as a transparent baseline. The study underscores practical requirements for accent restoration - Unicode-safe preprocessing, mark-aware tokenization, and evaluation that separates grapheme from accent errors - and positions heritage-language technology as an emerging NLP area connecting computational modeling with philological and pedagogical aims. Results establish reproducible baselines for Rigvedic accent restoration and provide guidance for downstream tasks such as accent-aware OCR, ASR/chant synthesis, and digital scholarship."}

We also build a factorized synthetic data manifold combining 2D generative diversity with geometry-consistent 3D renderings, supported by a training scheme that improves realism and identity consistency. A robust proxy-mesh tracker maintains stability under partial visibility. Together, these components enable strong in-the-wild generalization.

Although open-source models sometimes approach GPT-4 and prior benchmarks, no configuration yields consistently reliable predictions in zero-shot binary settings. Moreover, aggregate metrics such as accuracy and macro-F1 mask significant asymmetries, with per-class recall offering clearer diagnostic value.

Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design."}

While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as \"think with image\", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a \"short is long\" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning."}

However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%.

However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding.

In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

Differentiating between safety influenced refusals or politically motivated censorship is hard and unclear. For this purpose we introduce PSP, a dataset built specifically to probe the refusal behaviors in LLMs from an explicitly political context. PSP is built by formatting existing censored content from two data sources, openly available on the internet: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets that have been censored in various countries. We study: 1) impact of political sensitivity in seven LLMs through data-driven (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing the concept of politics); and, 2) vulnerability of models on PSP through prompt injection attacks (PIAs). Associating censorship with refusals on content with masked implicit intent, we find that most LLMs perform some form of censorship. We conclude with summarizing major attributes that can cause a shift in refusal distributions across models and contexts of different countries."}

To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.\n  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.\n  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations.

To address these limitations, we employ reasoning-based generation to output both the quadruple and a natural language rationale under element prefixes within a unified template, encouraging explicit relational reasoning and interpretability. To further enhance element-wise alignment, we introduce a listwise preference optimization framework for improving structural validity and relational coherence.

Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models."}

At the global level, the agent is localized on SMG and a goal-conditioned node path is planned via an image-to-instance hybrid retrieval, producing a sequence of reachable waypoints for long-horizon guidance. At the local level, a navigation foundation policy executes these waypoints in point-goal mode with obstacle-aware control, and switches to image-goal mode when navigating from the final node towards the visual target.

In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting.

Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift.

To enable this, we propose a lightweight three-stage training framework that learns a single prompt-specific Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]). The framework first trains [BE] to encode the natural-language content of the original system prompt via reconstruction, and then distills the prompt 's downstream behavior into this single token. Importantly, our method requires no access to model internals, no auxiliary compression models, and no labeled responses. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that a single [BE] token achieves up to a 3000x reduction in prompt length, while retaining about 98% of the downstream performance of the original system prompts.

To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision.

GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking.

The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance."}

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset.

Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains.

While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive.

However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities."}

To further enhance these capabilities, we introduce a lightweight alignment scheme that refines their internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving all decoder heads frozen.

We hypothesize that the presence of ambiguous content during DPO training may introduce ambiguity, thereby limiting further improvements in alignment. Through mathematical analysis and proof-of-concept experiments, we reveal that ambiguous content may potentially introduce ambiguities, thereby degrading performance. To address this issue, we introduce Ambiguity Awareness Optimization (AAO), a simple yet effective approach that automatically re-weights ambiguous content to reduce ambiguities by calculating semantic similarity from preference pairs.

Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss.

The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model.

In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking."}

Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources."}

Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation."}

We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult.

The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys."}

However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.

We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments."}

To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI."}

To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines.

While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable.

However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures.

On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models."}

Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments."}

Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning.

In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions."}

In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously.

SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure.

By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions.

However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic."}

We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices.

In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation."}

In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering.

Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to \"get the right answer for the right visual reason\". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models."}

However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices."}

While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows."}

Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments."}

Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D.

The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the \"affective gap\" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the \"affective gap\". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks."}

To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning.

To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories.

To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings.

However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \\textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications.

To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision.

Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed."}

We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking."}

MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%."}

While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods.

Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives."}

Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings."}

Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget."}

Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\\times$ 1024).

In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction.

To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability."}

This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to \"think with videos\". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM"}

Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced."}

However, standard prompting leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify the emerging misinformation, which ignores the misinformation attribution. To this end, we present Insight-A, exploring attribution with MLLM insights for detecting multimodal misinformation. Insight-A makes two efforts: I) attribute misinformation to forgery sources, and II) an effective pipeline with hierarchical reasoning that detects distortions across modalities. Specifically, to attribute misinformation to forgery traces based on generation patterns, we devise cross-attribution prompting (CAP) to model the sophisticated correlations between perception and reasoning. Meanwhile, to reduce the subjectivity of human-annotated prompts, automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) is used for task adaptation on MLLMs. Additionally, we design image captioning (IC) to achieve visual details for enhancing cross-modal consistency checking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposal and provide a new paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection in the era of AIGC."}

In open-domain applications visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring models to perform structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment. We introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating contradiction detection in multimodal inputs. The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification."}

In addition to describing pathological findings in chest X-ray reports, interpreting lines and tubes (L&T) is demanding and repetitive for radiologists, especially with high patient volumes. We introduce MAIRA-X, a clinically evaluated multimodal AI model for longitudinal chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, that encompasses both clinical findings and L&T reporting. Developed using a large-scale, multi-site, longitudinal dataset of 3.1 million studies (comprising 6 million images from 806k patients) from Mayo Clinic, MAIRA-X was evaluated on three holdout datasets and the public MIMIC-CXR dataset, where it significantly improved AI-generated reports over the state of the art on lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T-related elements. A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects. The user study found comparable rates of critical errors (3.0% for original vs. 4.6% for AI-generated reports) and a similar rate of acceptable sentences (97.8% for original vs. 97.4% for AI-generated reports), marking a significant improvement over prior user studies with larger gaps and higher error rates. Our results suggest that MAIRA-X can effectively assist radiologists, particularly in high-volume clinical settings."}

Given an idiom, the system iteratively (i) generates detailed visual prompts, (ii) synthesizes an image, (iii) infers the idiom from the image, and (iv) refines the prompt until recognition succeeds or a step limit is reached. Using 1,000 idioms as inputs, we synthesize a corresponding dataset of visual pun images with paired prompts, enabling benchmarking of both generation and understanding. Experiments across 10 LLMs, 10 MLLMs, and one T2IM (Qwen-Image) show that MLLM choice is the primary performance driver: GPT achieves the highest accuracies, Gemini follows, and the best open-source MLLM (Gemma) is competitive with some closed models. On the LLM side, Claude attains the strongest average performance for prompt generation."}

Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models."}

While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by training only a small portion of model weights. However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities."}
