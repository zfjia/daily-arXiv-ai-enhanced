Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where\nhigher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the\nreliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction\nhierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first\n\"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority\n(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability\nvia training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of\nconstraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both\naligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight\nreinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning\ncapabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models\nachieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction\nhierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to\nsafety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety\nissues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined\nhigher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against\njailbreak and prompt injection attacks.

In\nthis study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges\nusing Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a\nsimple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse\ntraining subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation\nperformance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial\nredundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations.

We demonstrate that selective\nDQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively\nrestores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.\nAdditionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization\nand reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer.

Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large\nlanguage models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating\nthe tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring\npreservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the\nperformance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their\nlinguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a\nhuman benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral\n24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential\narchitectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a\ntempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a\nsuite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),\nwhile preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also\nattains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a\ndisconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a\nstatistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a\ncomprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,\ndiscourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for\nmechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five\nreadability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the\nevolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the\ninstruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics\nfor metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary\ndomain-adaptation issue for simplification."}

We curate a diverse, moderately\nchallenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is\nbeneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires\nthe integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and\nreasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative\nbenchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,\nmathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2\nexhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for\nperception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement\nlearning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to\nselectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide\nguidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models."}

To overcome this,\nwe introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two\nnovel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which\npartitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing\ncomplexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared\nspline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise\nnonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),\nGroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11\npercent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),\nand shows improved interpretability."}

Official code:\n  https://github.com/Time-Search/TimeSearch-R", "summary": "Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens\nof thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate\nlong-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow\nthe search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted\nsearch process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search\nstrategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal\nsearch as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching\nvideo clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).\nHowever, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate\nsearch decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content\nand inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO\nwith Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video\nframes from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy\nmodel to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the\ncompleteness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets\nspecifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,\nfiltering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task\ndifficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal\nsearch benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as\nlong-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,\nTimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%\nimprovement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video\nreasoning model Video-R1.

Several previous studies have tried to enhance\nthe spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert\nencoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.\nTo enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual\nSpatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with\nhuman-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We\nfirst attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a\nlarge-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning\n19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present\nVST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in\nspace. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised\nfine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement\nlearning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the\nside-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\\%$ on\nMMSI-Bench and $61.2\\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the\nVision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed\nspatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI."}
