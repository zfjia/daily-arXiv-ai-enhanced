The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation\nof the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs\nto be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this\nobjective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and\ntheir representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further\ninvestigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of\nthese representations to steer the models' behaviour.

The resulting\npersonality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible\nsteering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of\ntrait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits\noccupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be\ntransformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful\nperturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,\nhelping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model\nalignment."}

However, since all the response tokens share a common\nimportance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,\nleading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a\ndecrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which\napplies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and\nGSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also\nprevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping\nmechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily\nadjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and\nnarrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves\nan average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and\nGSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These\nresults highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking\nthe essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings."}

However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated\ndatasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised\nAI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative\nbaseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained\nYOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate\nthe initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data\nfor the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by\nproviding a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further\nmanual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal\nconsistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively\nevaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of\nground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,\nand test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory\nperformance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted\napproach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods\nof complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually\nprompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world\nscenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more\nefficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods."}

From an apple\nbeing cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through\nthese changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.\nHowever, existing methods often lose track of the target object after\ntransformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address\nthis limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects\nthrough transformations while detecting and describing state changes,\naccompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we\npresent TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after\ntransformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.\nTubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines\nwhether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,\nit reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each\nobserved transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking\nperformance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of\nobject transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and\nsemantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional\nresults, and the benchmark dataset are available at\nhttps://tubelet-graph.github.io."}

Although several works have proposed\ntechniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem\nof producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we\nmotivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications,\nintroduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the\nefficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as\na pre-processing step.
