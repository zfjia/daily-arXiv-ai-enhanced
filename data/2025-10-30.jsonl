Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families.

Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to\nimprove model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by\nprocessing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph\nstructures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the\nefficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of\ngraph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we\npropose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view\nData (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear\nfeature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the\nGCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)\ncorrecting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples\nnear class boundaries.

Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned\nimplicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,\nwe design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic\nalignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce\nsemantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the\nsecond challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by\nfinetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This\ngenerator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth\nreasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing\nfor accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by\njointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic\nalignment with ground-truth reasoning.

To solve these problems, a\nhybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is\nproposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for\neach modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs\nthe features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about\nthe emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different\nmodalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to\nreduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship\nbetween interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between\ndifferent modalities.

This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for\nlicense plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the\nperformance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and\nNew York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset\nfrom the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and\n91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised\nlearning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with\npseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.\nGrounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many\nimages with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance\non labor-intensive manual labeling.

We therefore assume\ncitation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency\nwith which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the\npretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated\nreferences in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified\n100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured\nfactual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic\nmetadata.

This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation\nof high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.\n1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve\nthe target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since\nthe model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its\nperformance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become\nbiased towards the generated data.\n  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original\nrectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into\nthe training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method\neffectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data.

To this\nend, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and\ngaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors\nduring inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded\nspecific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,\nwhich extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using\nthe shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared\nbackbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain\nhead-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head\ndetection branch to predict the head of each person.
