Second paper in TAAC research series. Code and data at https://github.com/micoverde/taac-llm-compression", "summary": "In \"Compress or Route?\" (Johnson, 2026), we found that code generation tolerates aggressive prompt compression (r >= 0.6) while chain-of-thought reasoning degrades gradually. That study was limited to HumanEval (164 problems), left the \"perplexity paradox\" mechanism unvalidated, and provided no adaptive algorithm. This paper addresses all three gaps. First, we validate across six code benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, HumanEval+, MultiPL-E) and four reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, ARC-Challenge, MMLU-STEM), confirming the compression threshold generalizes across languages and difficulties. Second, we conduct the first per-token perplexity analysis (n=723 tokens), revealing a \"perplexity paradox\": code syntax tokens are preserved (high perplexity) while numerical values in math problems are pruned despite being task-critical (low perplexity). Signature injection recovers +34 percentage points in pass rate (5.3% to 39.3%; Cohen's h=0.890). Third, we propose TAAC (Task-Aware Adaptive Compression), achieving 22% cost reduction with 96% quality preservation, outperforming fixed-ratio compression by 7%. MBPP validation (n=1,800 trials) confirms systematic variation: 3.6% at r=0.3 to 54.6% at r=1.0."}

However, the heterogeneity of the structure and semantics of these tables makes it challenging to build a unified method that can effectively leverage the information they contain. Meanwhile, Large language models (LLMs) are becoming an increasingly integral component of web infrastructure for tasks like semantic search. This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\\textbf{Ta}$ble $\\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows. We first show that naive application of these embeddings underperforms compared to specialized tabular models. We then demonstrate that their potentials can be unlocked with two key techniques: removing the common component from all embeddings and calibrating the softmax temperature. We show that a simple meta-learner, trained on handcrafted features, can learn to predict an appropriate temperature. This approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes ($k \\leq 32$) of semantically-rich tables. Our findings demonstrate the viability of reusing existing LLM infrastructure for efficient semantics-driven pathway to reuse existing LLM infrastructure for Web table understanding."}

We begin by introducing both MT and KD for non-experts, followed by an overview of the standard KD approaches relevant to MT applications. Subsequently, we categorize advances in the KD4MT literature based on (i) their methodological contributions and (ii) their practical applications. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses identify common trends in the field and highlight key research gaps as well as the absence of unified evaluation practice for KD methods in MT. We further provide practical guidelines for selecting a KD method in concrete settings and highlight potential risks associated with the application of KD to MT such as increased hallucination and bias amplification.

Our design uses a token update mask and staged training to control the scope and timing of structural updates.

The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides a cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems."}

Geometric Limitations of Steering in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\\% and 4.02\\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection."}

This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures.

To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization."}

However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons.

We highlight how LLMs enable easy connections of NLP pipelines with abstract narrative concepts and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Challenges remain in attempts to work towards any unified definition or benchmark of narrative related tasks, making model comparison difficult. For future directions, instead of the pursuit of a single, generalised benchmark for 'narrative quality', we believe that progress benefits more from efforts that focus on the following: defining and improving theory-based metrics for individual narrative attributes to incrementally improve model performance; conducting large-scale, theory-driven literary/social/cultural analysis; and creating experiments where outputs can be used to validate or refine narrative theories. This work provides a contextual foundation for more systematic and theoretically informed narrative research in NLP by providing an overview to ongoing research efforts and the broader narrative studies landscape."}

This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training.

Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues.

In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion.

We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

However, its scalability is hindered by excessive context length and redundant retrievals. Recent research on soft context compression aims to address this by encoding long documents into compact embeddings, yet they often underperform non-compressed RAG due to their reliance on auto-encoder-like full-compression that forces the encoder to compress all document information regardless of relevance to the input query.\n  In this work, we conduct an analysis on this paradigm and reveal two fundamental limitations: (I) Infeasibility, full-compression conflicts with the LLM's downstream generation behavior; and (II) Non-necessity: full-compression is unnecessary and dilutes task-relevant information density. Motivated by these insights, we introduce SeleCom, a selector-based soft compression framework for RAG that redefines the encoder's role as query-conditioned information selector. The selector is decoder-only and is trained with a massive, diverse and difficulty-graded synthetic QA dataset with curriculum learning.\n  Extensive experiments show that SeleCom significantly outperforms existing soft compression approaches and achieves competitive or superior performance to non-compression baselines, while reducing computation and latency by 33.8%~84.6%."}

To boost both effectiveness and transferability in this setting, we propose a new detect-segment-identify pipeline that leverages the Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and the Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. To evaluate our approach, we publish a collection of nine days CCTV data filmed on a working dairy farm.

This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (CRAF) framework that systematically integrates traditional feature-based methods with large language models (LLMs) through a structured multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Our approach features four key innovations: (1) a cross-platform collaborative attention module that aligns semantic representations while preserving source-specific characteristics, (2) a hierarchical adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically weights features based on both data quality and task requirements, (3) a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously learns topic representations and sentiment distributions through shared latent spaces, and (4) a novel multimodal extraction capability that processes video content from platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou by integrating OCR, ASR, and visual sentiment analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRAF achieves a tighter generalization bound with a reduction of O(sqrt(d log K / m)) compared to independent source modeling, where d is feature dimensionality, K is the number of sources, and m is sample size. Comprehensive experiments on three multi-platform datasets (Weibo-12, CrossPlatform-15, NewsForum-8) show that CRAF achieves an average topic clustering ARI of 0.76 (4.1% improvement over best baseline) and sentiment analysis F1-score of 0.84 (3.8% improvement).

However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.\n  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.\n  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.\n  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm.

An underexplored factor in these settings is the representation of the state. Holding model parameters fixed, we systematically vary three key aspects: (1) state granularity (long form versus summary), (2) structure (natural language versus symbolic), and (3) spatial grounding (text-only versus images or textual map encodings) across sequential decision-making benchmarks. We find that trajectory summarisation improves performance by reducing noise and stabilising long-horizon reasoning. Second, natural language representations are the most robust across models, whereas structured encodings help mainly for models with strong code or structured output priors, such as JSON schemas. Third, while image-inputs show some benefit, text-based spatial encodings prove most effective. This advantage stems not from the spatial information itself, but from the act of construction, which compels the model to perform the spatial reasoning that static input does not elicit. Overall, we demonstrate that design choices for representing state are a decisive factor in performance, distinct from the availability of information itself. We note, however, that even with improved representations, current LLMs and VLMs remain brittle over long horizons, particularly when they must synthesise information to manage multiple subtasks to reach a goal."}

Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task."}

Incoming transcripts are first graded using a simplified adaptation of the PIPA framework, focusing on observation alignment and appropriate response behavior, and are filtered to retain only high-quality interactions exhibiting coherent flow and effective human agent responses. Structured knowledge is then extracted from curated transcripts using large language models (LLMs) and deployed as the sole grounding source in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Assistant behavior is governed through systematic prompt tuning, progressing from monolithic prompts to lean, modular, and governed designs that ensure consistency, safety, and controllable execution. Evaluation is conducted using a transcript-grounded user simulator, enabling quantitative measurement of call coverage, factual accuracy, and human escalation behavior. Additional red teaming assesses robustness against prompt injection, out-of-scope, and out-of-context attacks.

Here, we introduce BTReport, an open-source framework for brain tumor RRG that constructs natural language radiology reports using deterministically extracted imaging features. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG.

Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.\n  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.\n  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization.

However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies."}

Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation.

The game's dialogue-based structure provides a controlled environment for assessing how LLM-based chatbots interpret natural language descriptions and generate appropriate action sequences to succeed in the game. We test the performance of leading proprietary models - ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini - under both minimal and detailed instructions, measuring game progress through achieved scores as the primary metric. Our results reveal that all tested models achieve less than 10% completion on average, with even the best-performing model (Claude Opus 4.5) reaching only approximately 75 out of 350 possible points. Notably, providing detailed game instructions offers no improvement, nor does enabling ''extended thinking''. Qualitative analysis of the models' reasoning processes reveals fundamental limitations: repeated unsuccessful actions suggesting an inability to reflect on one's own thinking, inconsistent persistence of strategies, and failure to learn from previous attempts despite access to conversation history. These findings suggest substantial limitations in current LLMs' metacognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities within the domain of text-based games, raising questions about the nature and extent of their reasoning capabilities."}

We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference.

This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities.

Existing defenses mainly employ gradient perturbation techniques, e.g., noise injection or gradient pruning, to disrupt GIAs' direct mapping from gradient space to token space. However, these methods often fall short due to the retention of semantics similarity across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism named GHOST (gradient shield with obfuscated tokens), a token-level obfuscation mechanism that neutralizes GIAs by decoupling the inherent connections across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. GHOST is built upon an important insight: due to the large scale of the token space, there exist semantically distinct yet embedding-proximate tokens that can serve as the shadow substitutes of the original tokens, which enables a semantic disconnection in the token space while preserving the connection in the embedding and gradient spaces. GHOST comprises a searching step, which identifies semantically distinct candidate tokens using a multi-criteria searching process, and a selection step, which selects optimal shadow tokens to ensure minimal disruption to features critical for training by preserving alignment with the internal outputs produced by original tokens. Evaluation across diverse model architectures (from BERT to Llama) and datasets demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness of GHOST in protecting privacy (as low as 1% in recovery rate) and preserving utility (up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity), in both classification and generation tasks against state-of-the-art GIAs and adaptive attack scenarios."}

Moreover, most methods rely on single-step retrieval, neglecting the need for multi-hop reasoning processes. Recent training-based approaches attempt to incentivize the large language models (LLMs) for iterative reasoning and retrieval, but their training processes are prone to unstable convergence and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we devise an ontology-based cube structure with multiple and orthogonal dimensions to model structural subjects, attributes, and relations. Built on the cube structure, we propose MultiCube-RAG, a training-free method consisting of multiple cubes for multi-step reasoning and retrieval. Each cube specializes in modeling a class of subjects, so that MultiCube-RAG flexibly selects the most suitable cubes to acquire the relevant knowledge precisely. To enhance the query-based reasoning and retrieval, our method decomposes a complex multi-hop query into a set of simple subqueries along cube dimensions and conquers each of them sequentially. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that MultiCube-RAG improves response accuracy by 8.9% over the average performance of various baselines. Notably, we also demonstrate that our method performs with greater efficiency and inherent explainability."}

SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention."}

However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior."}

However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users."}

In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU."}

Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs.

To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline."}

Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks."}

In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering. We evaluate GCM on three tasks--refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer--across three language models. GCM successfully localizes concepts expressed in long-form responses and consistently outperforms correlational probe-based baselines when steering with a sparse set of attention heads. Together, these results demonstrate that GCM provides an effective approach for localizing and controlling the long-form responses of LMs."}

Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities."}

Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack."}

These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation."}

REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who \"execute\" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs."}

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT.

We formalize this tension by quantifying the \"uncertainty gap\" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness."}

Preprint submitted to Pattern Recognition Letters", "summary": "Despite the continuous research and evolution of language models, they sometimes underperform previous versions. Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation."}

Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing."}

First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems."}

However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency."}

This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.\n  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation. Taken together, this paper provides a unifying conceptual framework for understanding how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, lost, evaluated, and manifested in deployed language model systems."}

To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities.

To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs.

Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics."}

Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained."}

While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning."}

One class of benchmarks evaluates memorization by testing recall of past conversations or text but fails to capture how memory is used to guide future decisions. Another class focuses on agents acting in single-session tasks without the need for long-term memory. However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task. MemoryArena supports evaluation across web navigation, preference-constrained planning, progressive information search, and sequential formal reasoning, and reveals that agents with near-saturated performance on existing long-context memory benchmarks like LoCoMo perform poorly in our agentic setting, exposing a gap in current evaluations for agents with memory."}

Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content.

Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models."}

However, translated text differs systematically from native text. This phenomenon is known as translationese, and it reflects both traces of the source language and characteristic properties of translation itself. In this paper, we study how training on machine-translated data affects small English language models, focusing on how translationese from different source languages shapes linguistic acceptability judgments and language modelling for different domains. We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data."}

To address this, we introduce Team-of-Thoughts, a novel MAS architecture that leverages the complementary capabilities of heterogeneous agents via an orchestrator-tool paradigm. Our framework introduces two key mechanisms to optimize performance: (1) an orchestrator calibration scheme that identifies models with superior coordination capabilities, and (2) a self-assessment protocol where tool agents profile their own domain expertise to account for variations in post-training skills. During inference, the orchestrator dynamically activates the most suitable tool agents based on these proficiency profiles. Experiments on five reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that Team-of-Thoughts delivers consistently superior task performance. Notably, on AIME24 and LiveCodeBench, our approach achieves accuracies of 96.67% and 72.53%, respectively, substantially outperforming homogeneous role-play baselines, which score 80% and 65.93%."}

They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need. This work presents a scalable approach to developing AI systems that effectively learn from language feedback."}

We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop. Overall, our results position depth growth and looping as complementary, practical methods for inducing and scaling iterative computation to improve reasoning."}

To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives."}

Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention."}

In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the \"numeric ambiguity\" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling."}

Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore.

Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models."}

LLM-as-a-jury for Comparative Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability."}

Includes appendix with detailed experimental results and prompts", "summary": "Evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly requires moving beyond static text generation toward dynamic, adversarial interaction. We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($ρ= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities."}

This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes \"lexical density\" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models."}

However, recent efforts to extend alignment to other languages often require substantial resources, either through large-scale, high-quality supervision in the target language or through pairwise alignment with high-resource languages, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility. Further evaluation across languages and tasks indicates improved cross-lingual generalization, suggesting the proposed approach as a practical solution for multilingual consistency alignment under limited supervision."}

In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies."}

Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures."}
